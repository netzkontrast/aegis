# Agent Action Log

This file contains a reverse-chronological record of all actions, decisions, and observations made by the Zettelkasten agent. It serves multiple purposes:

1. **Auditability**: Track what the agent has done and why
2. **Learning Exhaust**: Capture identified knowledge gaps and open questions
3. **Prioritization Input**: The agent reads this log to identify explicit user requests
4. **Debugging**: Understand the agent's reasoning when issues occur

## 🔄 How Concepts Interconnect

### 1. ANP-EP Phobia → Validation Hierarchy

**[[ZTL-20251105-2131-ANP-EP-Phobia-Dynamics]]** defines the core internal conflict.

This conflict must appear in:
- **Layer 3** (CODEX law): Section 2.2 defines it
- **Layer 2** (NCP): Character relationships marked "Phobic"
- **Layer 1** (Thematic checkpoints): "Show ANP-EP phobia"
- **Layer 0** (Beats): Lex suppresses Kiko's fear

**Validation flow:**
[[ZTL-20251105-2131-NCP-Validation-Hierarchy]] checks that ANP-EP phobia appears correctly at all layers.

---

### 2. Psycho-Architecture → Four Kernwelten

**[[ZTL-20251105-2131-Psycho-Architecture]]** is the theory: psychology = physics.

**[[ZTL-20251105-2131-Four-Kernwelten-System]]** is the implementation:
- KW1 = ANP rationalization
- KW2 = EP trauma
- KW3 = Protector defenses
- KW4 = Integration potential

**Connection:**
Each world's physics derives from psychological principle. ANP-EP phobia creates world boundaries and "Risse" (rifts).

---

### 3. Scene Beats → Prose Evolution

**[[ZTL-20251105-2131-Scene-Beat-Architecture]]** provides the structure (Goal/Conflict/Beats).

**[[ZTL-20251105-2131-Prose-Evolution-Tracking]]** provides the style:
- Fragmented (Ch 1-3): Unconscious plurality
- Transitional (Ch 7-10): Emerging voices
- Polyphonic (Ch 13+): Functional multiplicity

**Connection:**
Beat structure is consistent across all chapters, but prose style evolves to match character integration state.

---

### 4. Validation Hierarchy → Scene Architecture

**[[ZTL-20251105-2131-NCP-Validation-Hierarchy]]** defines 4 layers of checking.

**[[ZTL-20251105-2131-Scene-Beat-Architecture]]** implements the structure being validated:
- Beats (Layer 0)
- Thematic checkpoints (Layer 1)
- NCP throughlines (Layer 2)
- CODEX laws (Layer 3)

**Connection:**
Every scene element can be traced up/down the validation hierarchy.

---

**Skills Developed:**
- Understanding constraint propagation
- Seeing how philosophy constrains design
- Identifying load-bearing principles

**Deliverable:** Law → Implementation flowchart

---

### Rep 4: Reverse Engineering - Design Your Own Scene
**Focus:** [[ZTL-20251105-2131-Scene-Beat-Architecture]] + all concepts

Apply the framework to create a new validated scene.

**Skills Developed:**
- Scene design using NCP
- Self-validation
- Creative application of constraints

- Synthesis across multiple concepts
- Adapting framework to new contexts

**Deliverable:** "Using NCP for Narrative Coherence" guide (2-3k words)

---

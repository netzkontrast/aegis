# Comparative Analysis: Skill Authoring Approaches

## Overview

This analysis compares four complementary approaches to skill design:
1. **writing-skills** - TDD-focused methodology
2. **Anthropic best practices** - Official pragmatic guidance
3. **Graphviz conventions** - Visual process DSL
4. **Persuasion principles** - Psychology-based compliance

## Philosophical Alignment Map

```
RIGOROUS ←──────────────────────────→ PRAGMATIC
         writing-skills              Anthropic

ENFORCEMENT ←──────────────────────→ GUIDANCE
         persuasion                  clarity

PROCESS ←──────────────────────────→ CONTENT
         workflows                   reference
```

## Core Philosophy Comparison

| Aspect | writing-skills | Anthropic | Persuasion | Graphviz |
|--------|----------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| **Primary Goal** | Prevent rationalization | Optimize discoverability | Ensure compliance | Encode process semantics |
| **Tone** | Dogmatic, strict | Pragmatic, balanced | Authoritative (when needed) | Descriptive, systematic |
| **Testing Stance** | Mandatory TDD | "Build evaluations first" | N/A (meta-level) | N/A (visual tool) |
| **Target Audience** | High-discipline users | All skill authors | Skill designers | Process documenters |
| **Flexibility** | Low (Iron Law) | High (judgment-based) | Medium (principle-based) | Low (shape semantics) |

## Testing Methodology Comparison

### writing-skills (TDD Approach)

**Stance:** Iron Law - NO SKILL WITHOUT FAILING TEST

**Process:**
1. RED: Run pressure scenarios WITHOUT skill, document baseline
2. GREEN: Write minimal skill addressing specific failures
3. REFACTOR: Close loopholes, re-test until bulletproof

**Strengths:**
- Extremely rigorous
- Prevents under-testing
- Catches rationalization patterns early
- Systematic improvement cycle

**Weaknesses:**
- High overhead for simple skills
- Could feel intimidating
- May be overkill for reference skills
- Requires significant time investment

### Anthropic (Evaluation-Driven)

**Stance:** "Build evaluations first" (recommended, not mandatory)

**Process:**
1. Identify gaps (run Claude without skill)
2. Create 3 evaluations
3. Establish baseline
4. Write minimal instructions
5. Iterate

**Strengths:**
- Pragmatic balance
- Lower barrier to entry
- Flexible iteration
- Real-world focused

**Weaknesses:**
- Less rigorous enforcement
- "Evaluations first" could be skipped
- No explicit rationalization testing
- Softer on discipline skills

### Synthesis

**Question:** Are these compatible or conflicting?

**Answer:** Complementary for different skill types

| Skill Type | Recommended Approach | Rationale |
|------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Discipline-enforcing** | writing-skills (TDD) | High stakes, rationalization risk |
| **Technique/guidance** | Anthropic (eval-driven) | Need flexibility, less fragile |
| **Reference** | Anthropic (minimal testing) | Low complexity, clear pass/fail |
| **Collaborative** | Anthropic + persuasion (unity) | Balance enforcement with culture |

**Recommendation:** Use TDD rigor for HIGH-STAKES skills, pragmatic iteration for others

## Content Structure Comparison

### writing-skills Structure

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Use when [conditions] - [what it does]
---

## Overview
Core principle (1-2 sentences)

## When to Use
[Flowchart if non-obvious]
Symptoms and use cases

## Core Pattern
Before/after comparison

## Quick Reference
Table/bullets

## Implementation
Inline or linked

## Common Mistakes
What goes wrong + fixes
```

**Focus:** Clear structure, explicit anti-patterns

### Anthropic Structure

```markdown
---
name: Skill Name
description: What + when, third person, keywords
---

# Skill Name

[Overview]
[Quick start with inline example]
[Advanced features → separate files]
[Workflows with checklists]
[Feedback loops]
```

**Focus:** Progressive disclosure, token efficiency, discoverability

### Key Differences

| Aspect | writing-skills | Anthropic |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| **Name format** | kebab-case with hyphens | Title Case |
| **Description** | "Use when" first | What first, then when |
| **Token budget** | <500 words total | <500 lines SKILL.md body |
| **File splitting** | Heavy reference or tools | Anything pushing 500 lines |
| **Flowcharts** | Only for non-obvious decisions | Same guidance |
| **Examples** | One excellent example | Input/output pairs |

### Synthesis

**Common ground:**
- Both emphasize conciseness
- Both use progressive disclosure
- Both avoid narrative storytelling
- Both prioritize searchability

**Recommendation:** Merge into unified structure
- Use Anthropic's token efficiency (<500 lines body)
- Use writing-skills's explicit "When to Use" section
- Use Anthropic's progressive disclosure patterns
- Keep both approaches to examples (1 excellent + I/O pairs as needed)

## Discoverability (CSO) Comparison

### writing-skills (Claude Search Optimization)

**Description field:**
- Start with "Use when..."
- Technology-agnostic unless skill is tech-specific
- Third person
- Max 1024 chars

**Keywords:**
- Error messages
- Symptoms
- Synonyms
- Tool names

**Naming:**
- Active voice, verb-first
- Gerunds: `creating-skills`

**Token efficiency:**
- getting-started: <150 words
- Frequent: <200 words
- Other: <500 words

### Anthropic

**Description field:**
- What + when
- Third person
- Be specific, include key terms
- Max 1024 chars

**Naming:**
- Prefer gerund form: "Processing PDFs"
- Avoid vague names

**Token efficiency:**
- SKILL.md body: <500 lines

### Key Differences

| Aspect | writing-skills | Anthropic |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| **Description start** | "Use when" (condition-first) | What + when (either order) |
| **Tech specificity** | Explicit guidance (agnostic unless tech-specific) | Less explicit |
| **Token metrics** | Word count (150/200/500) | Line count (<500 lines) |
| **Keyword emphasis** | Very explicit (errors, symptoms, synonyms) | Implied ("include key terms") |

### Synthesis

**Recommendation:** Combine both approaches
- Start with "Use when" (writing-skills clarity)
- Include specific keywords (writing-skills emphasis)
- Technology-agnostic by default (writing-skills guidance)
- Use line count for body, word count for frequently-loaded (practical metric)
- Third person (both agree)

## Persuasion Integration Analysis

### Where Persuasion Appears in writing-skills

**Heavy use of Authority principle:**
```markdown
NO SKILL WITHOUT FAILING TEST FIRST
No exceptions:
- Not for "simple additions"
- Not for "just adding a section"
```

**Heavy use of Commitment principle:**
```markdown
## Red Flags - STOP and Start Over
- Code before test
- "I already manually tested it"
```

**Heavy use of Social Proof:**
```markdown
| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Too simple to test" | Simple code breaks. Every time. |
```

**Analysis:** writing-skills IMPLICITLY uses persuasion heavily (Authority + Commitment + Social Proof)

### Where Persuasion Appears in Anthropic

**Moderate use of Authority:**
```markdown
ALWAYS use this exact template structure:
```

**Minimal persuasion in most examples:**
```markdown
Here is a sensible default format, but use your best judgment.
```

**Analysis:** Anthropic uses persuasion SELECTIVELY (only when strictness needed)

### Integration Pattern

| Skill Type | writing-skills Approach | Anthropic Approach | Optimal Synthesis |
|------------|------------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| **Discipline** | Heavy Authority + Commitment | Light authority | Use writing-skills (rationalization risk high) |
| **Technique** | Moderate authority | Moderate authority | Aligned (no change needed) |
| **Reference** | Clarity only | Clarity only | Aligned (no change needed) |
| **Collaborative** | Not explicitly addressed | Pragmatic tone | Add Unity principle (from persuasion) |

### Synthesis

**Key insight:** writing-skills documentation PRACTICES what persuasion principles PRESCRIBE

**Recommendation:**
1. Make persuasion principles explicit in writing-skills (cite research)
2. Add guidance on when to dial up/down persuasion
3. Soften tone for non-discipline skills
4. Keep heavy Authority for TDD enforcement

## Graphviz Integration Analysis

### Current Status

**writing-skills guidance:**
- Use flowcharts ONLY for non-obvious decisions
- Never for reference material, code, linear instructions

**Graphviz conventions:**
- Shape semantics (diamond=decision, box=action, etc.)
- Naming patterns (questions end with ?)
- Visual encoding of process structure

**Anthropic guidance:**
- No specific flowchart guidance
- Implies visual aids okay when helpful

### Integration Opportunities

**1. Add flowchart guidance to Anthropic docs**
- When to use (non-obvious decisions)
- When NOT to use (reference material)
- Link to graphviz conventions

**2. Expand graphviz conventions**
- Add "when flowchart is overkill" section
- Show markdown alternatives for simple flows
- Integration examples with SKILL.md

**3. Create skill structure flowchart**
Using graphviz conventions, create decision tree:
"What should I include in SKILL.md?" → diamond decisions

### Synthesis

**Recommendation:** Graphviz conventions are TOOL-LEVEL guidance
- Keep separate from main skill authoring docs
- Reference from "when to use flowcharts" sections
- Add cross-references both directions

## Contradiction Analysis

### Major Contradictions

#### 1. Testing Rigor: Iron Law vs. Recommendation

**writing-skills:**
```
NO SKILL WITHOUT FAILING TEST FIRST
No exceptions.
```

**Anthropic:**
```
Build evaluations first (recommended)
```

**Severity:** HIGH - fundamentally different philosophies

**Resolution options:**

A) **Accept both as valid** (skill-type dependent)
- Discipline skills → Iron Law
- Others → Evaluations recommended

B) **Soften writing-skills** (more pragmatic)
- Change "NO EXCEPTIONS" to "Strongly recommended for discipline skills"

C) **Harden Anthropic** (more rigorous)
- Change "recommended" to "required"

**Recommendation:** Option A (skill-type dependent)

#### 2. Token Metrics: Words vs. Lines

**writing-skills:**
- getting-started: <150 words
- Frequent: <200 words
- Other: <500 words

**Anthropic:**
- SKILL.md body: <500 lines

**Severity:** LOW - different metrics for different purposes

**Resolution:**
- Use LINES for total body length (Anthropic)
- Use WORDS for frequently-loaded skills (writing-skills)
- Both are valid constraints

### Minor Contradictions

#### 3. Description Format: Condition-First vs. Flexible

**writing-skills:**
```yaml
description: Use when [conditions] - [what it does]
```

**Anthropic:**
```yaml
description: What it does. Use when [conditions].
```

**Severity:** LOW - cosmetic difference

**Resolution:** Standardize on writing-skills format
- More explicit trigger for discovery
- Research-backed (CSO principles)

#### 4. Tone: Dogmatic vs. Pragmatic

**writing-skills:** "Delete it. Start over. No exceptions."

**Anthropic:** "Use your best judgment."

**Severity:** MEDIUM - affects user experience

**Resolution:** Tone should match skill type
- Discipline skills → Dogmatic (Authority principle)
- Guidance skills → Balanced
- Reference skills → Neutral

| **Pattern/mental model** | Recognition testing | Anthropic + examples | When to apply vs. not apply |
| **Reference** | Retrieval testing | Minimal (3 scenarios) | Can find info, correct application |

#### 3. Persuasion Principle Decision Tree ⭐

```
"What skill type?" [diamond]
  ↓
Discipline-enforcing?
  YES → Use Authority + Commitment + Social Proof heavily
  NO ↓
Technique/guidance?
  YES → Use moderate Authority + Unity
  NO ↓
Collaborative?
  YES → Use Unity + Commitment, avoid Authority
  NO ↓
Reference?
  YES → Use clarity only, no persuasion
```

### Medium-Impact Integrations

#### 4. Enhanced CSO Guidance

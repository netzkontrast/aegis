# MOC: Writing Excellence Integration Quest

**Type:** Map of Content (MOC)
**Created:** 2025-11-06
**Status:** 🟢 Active - Rep 1
**Quest Duration:** 5 weeks

---

## Quest Overview

**Goal:** Integrate exceptional writing into all AEGIS workflows—Zettelkasten notes, documentation, skills, and plans.

**Why this matters:**
Writing IS thinking. Your Zettelkasten, documentation, skills, and plans are your external cognition system. If the writing is unclear, your thinking is impaired. If it's excellent, your cognition compounds.

**Current state:**
Multiple writing systems operating in isolation:
- Skill authoring (TDD-rigorous)
- Zettelkasten notes (atomic concepts)
- Narrative writing (prose evolution)
- Command docs (practical examples)

**Target state:**
Unified writing standards across all domains, with templates and workflows that make excellence automatic.

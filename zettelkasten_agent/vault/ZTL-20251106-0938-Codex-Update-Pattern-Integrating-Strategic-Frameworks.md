## Atomic Concept

When a strategic narrative decision is made (captured in a Source Note), it must be integrated into PROJECT_CODEX.md to become canonical law. This integration follows a systematic pattern that preserves the Codex's authority while allowing it to evolve.

---

## The Integration Pattern

### Step 1: Identify Codex Sections Affected
Review the strategic decision and map it to existing Codex sections:
- Section 1.0: Philosophical foundation
- Section 2.0: Character architecture
- Section 3.0: World physics
- Section 4.0: Plot structure

**Example**: "Call to Wholeness" framework affects:
- 1.0 (adds master validation principle)
- 2.3 (redefines Juna/V)
- 4.1 (clarifies integration timeline)
- 4.2 (expands climax mechanics)

### Step 2: Add Master Principle First
If the decision introduces a global validation principle, add it to Section 1.0 as the highest-level constraint. This establishes the lens through which all other sections will be interpreted.

**Pattern**: Create Section 1.0.X as "The Supreme Validation Principle: [Name]"
- State the global directive clearly
- Explain why it's primary (not just parallel)
- Provide validation questions
- Assert authority over convenience

### Step 3: Expand Character/Entity Definitions
Update Section 2.X with detailed frameworks:
- Replace brief mentions with full subsections
- Add theoretical grounding (IFS, TSDP, etc.)
- Provide concrete mechanisms
- Include validation checklists

**Pattern**: Use subsections (2.X.1, 2.X.2) to organize:
- 2.X.1: Theoretical framework
- 2.X.2: Physical/mechanical implementation
- 2.X.3: Narrative function

### Step 4: Clarify Temporal Causality
If the decision affects plot timing, update Section 4.0 to make sequence explicit:
- Use phrases like "Critical principle:" and "Temporal Sequence (Critical):"
- Add validation checkpoints
- Include red flags for common errors

**Pattern**: State "X happens BEFORE Y" explicitly, not implicitly

### Step 5: Expand Climax Mechanics
Update Section 4.2 with detailed causal chains:
- Step-by-step progression
- Validation requirements as checklists
- Red flags for failure modes
- Thematic resolution mapping

**Pattern**: Break into subsections:
- 4.2.1: The Causal Chain
- 4.2.2: Thematic Victories
- 4.2.3: Philosophical Grounding
- 4.2.4: Validation Requirements

### Step 6: Cross-Reference Zettelkasten
Add new Section 6.0 (or update if exists) linking to Zettelkasten vault:
- List key ZTL notes for each major update
- Explain authority relationship
- Show integration loop

**Pattern**: Codex = laws, Zettelkasten = implementation details

---

## Why This Works

**Maintains Authority**: Codex remains supreme while allowing evolution
**Preserves Context**: Strategic decisions don't get lost in version history
**Enables Validation**: Clear checkpoints and red flags prevent drift
**Builds Knowledge**: Each update references Zettelkasten for deeper exploration

## Application Checklist

When integrating a strategic decision:

- [ ] Map decision to affected Codex sections
- [ ] Add master principle to Section 1.0 if applicable
- [ ] Expand entity definitions with subsections
- [ ] Make temporal causality explicit
- [ ] Provide validation checklists
- [ ] Cross-reference Zettelkasten vault
- [ ] Include red flags for common errors
- [ ] Test: Can someone validate a scene using only the updated Codex?

## Example: Call to Wholeness Integration

**Strategic Decision**: "Call to Wholeness" reorientation (SRC-20251106-0906)

**Sections Updated**:
1. Added 1.0.1: Supreme validation principle
2. Expanded 2.3 → 2.3.1, 2.3.2, 2.3.3: Juna/V as Exilant + Moonshine-Link
3. Clarified 4.1: Integration-before-climax timeline
4. Expanded 4.2 → 4.2.1-4.2.4: Detailed victory mechanics
5. Added 6.0-6.3: Zettelkasten integration

**Result**: Strategic framework is now canonical law with clear validation path

---

## Red Flags

🛑 **Avoid these mistakes**:

- Updating lower docs without updating Codex first (creates authority gap)
- Adding details without cross-referencing Zettelkasten (knowledge duplication)
- Making changes implicit rather than explicit (causes validation confusion)
- Skipping validation checklists (no way to verify compliance)
- Not stating temporal sequence clearly (plot logic becomes ambiguous)

# Critical Analysis: Problems, Assumptions, and Failure Modes

## Overview

This document critiques all four approaches, identifying:
- Unexamined assumptions
- Potential failure modes
- Over-/under-specification
- Missing considerations
- Implementation challenges

## Critique: writing-skills (TDD Approach)

### Unexamined Assumptions

**Assumption 1: Testing always proves necessity**
```
"If you didn't watch an agent fail without the skill,
you don't know if the skill teaches the right thing."
```

**Problem:** This assumes agent failure = skill need. False negatives exist:
- Agent succeeds by accident (got lucky)
- Agent succeeds with huge token waste (inefficient but "works")
- Agent succeeds slowly (missed optimization opportunity)

**Missing:** Performance/efficiency testing, not just pass/fail

**Assumption 2: Pressure scenarios reveal all rationalization patterns**

**Problem:** Rationalization is context-dependent:
- Agent may rationalize differently with different users
- New models may have different rationalization patterns
- Cultural context affects persuasion (international users?)
- Pressure scenarios may not cover real-world diversity

**Missing:** Longitudinal testing, diverse context testing

**Assumption 3: The Iron Law applies equally to all skill edits**

**Problem:** "Edit skill without testing? Same violation."
- Typo fixes don't need RED-GREEN-REFACTOR
- Formatting changes don't need pressure scenarios
- Adding a keyword to description doesn't need baseline testing

**Missing:** Proportional testing (major changes = rigorous, minor = lighter)

**Assumption 4: Bulletproofing is achievable**

**Problem:** "Re-test until bulletproof" assumes finite rationalization space
- LLMs are creative - new excuses emerge
- Adversarial agents can find loopholes indefinitely
- "Bulletproof" is an asymptotic goal, not achievable state

**Missing:** Definition of "good enough" vs. "bulletproof"

### Potential Failure Modes

**Failure Mode 1: Testing theater**
- Going through motions of RED-GREEN-REFACTOR
- Not actually documenting rationalizations verbatim
- Adding rationalization table without real baseline testing
- "Testing because I have to" vs. "testing to learn"

**Mitigation:** None provided in documentation

**Failure Mode 2: Over-testing paralysis**
- Spending 4 hours testing a 20-line reference skill
- Unable to ship because "not bulletproof enough"
- Perfect becomes enemy of good
- Skills never deployed because never "done"

**Mitigation:** Weak ("skill-type dependent") but not quantified

**Failure Mode 3: False sense of security**
- "I tested it, so it must work!"
- Tests pass but skill still fails in production
- Pressure scenarios don't match real usage
- Rationalizations change with model updates

**Mitigation:** Not addressed

**Failure Mode 4: Compliance fatigue**
- Heavy Authority language creates resistance
- Users start ignoring "YOU MUST" after seeing it everywhere
- Persuasion principles become background noise
- Checklist boxes checked automatically without reading

**Mitigation:** Not addressed

### Over-Specification

**Over-specified:**

1. **Mandatory deletion**
   ```
   Write code before test? Delete it. Start over.
   No exceptions:
   - Don't keep it as "reference"
   ```

   **Problem:** Sometimes you discover a skill need AFTER writing code. Forcing deletion destroys working code to satisfy ritual.

   **Better:** "If code exists, create tests that fail, THEN validate code against tests"

2. **Single Iron Law for all skills**

   **Problem:** Reference skills don't need the same rigor as discipline skills

   **Better:** Graduated testing requirements by skill type

3. **Rationalization table for every skill**

   **Problem:** Simple skills may have zero rationalizations

   **Better:** "Include rationalization table if you discovered 3+ excuses"

### Under-Specification

**Under-specified:**

1. **What constitutes "failing" test?**
   - Agent violates rule once?
   - Agent violates rule under pressure?
   - Agent violates rule majority of time?

   **Missing:** Quantified failure threshold

2. **How many pressure scenarios are enough?**
   - Document says "3+ combined pressures"
   - But which combinations?
   - How many total scenarios?

   **Missing:** Test scenario adequacy criteria

3. **When is bulletproofing "done"?**
   - "Re-test until bulletproof"
   - But what's the stopping condition?
   - How many REFACTOR cycles?

   **Missing:** Definition of done

4. **What if agent behavior changes with model update?**
   - Skill was bulletproof on Sonnet 3.5
   - Sonnet 4.0 has different rationalization patterns
   - Do you re-test? Re-bulletproof?

   **Missing:** Maintenance strategy

### Missing Considerations

**1. Cost-benefit analysis**
- No guidance on when testing overhead justified
- 4 hours testing for 20-line skill may not be worth it
- No ROI framework

**2. Skill lifecycle management**
- What happens when skill needs updating?
- How to deprecate skills?
- Versioning strategy?

**3. Cross-skill interactions**
- What if two skills conflict?
- What if skills create emergent behaviors?
- No integration testing guidance

**4. User expertise variation**
- Assumes all users can run pressure scenarios
- Assumes all users understand persuasion principles
- Assumes all users have time for rigorous testing

**5. Failure recovery**
- What if you ship untested skill and it fails?
- How to fix in production?
- Post-incident analysis?

### Philosophical Critique

**Central tension:** TDD for documentation vs. TDD for code

TDD for code:
- Tests define behavior objectively
- Pass/fail is binary
- Refactoring preserves behavior

TDD for skills:
- "Tests" are subjective (agent behavior)
- Pass/fail is contextual
- "Refactoring" changes behavior (new rules)

**Question:** Is the analogy valid, or is this forcing a code paradigm onto non-code artifact?

**Concern:** Documentation that requires testing might not be documentation - it might be specification. And specifications have different quality criteria than documentation.

## Critique: Anthropic Best Practices

### Unexamined Assumptions

**Assumption 1: Claude is already very smart**
```
"Default assumption: Claude is already very smart.
Only add context Claude doesn't already have."
```

**Problem:** This optimizes for Opus-level intelligence
- Haiku needs more context
- Future models may be smarter OR dumber
- "Already knows" varies by training data recency
- Domain-specific knowledge not in training data

**Missing:** Skill should degrade gracefully across intelligence levels

**Assumption 2: Conciseness always improves performance**

**Problem:** Sometimes verbosity helps
- Redundancy aids comprehension
- Examples + explanation > just examples
- Token cost vs. comprehension tradeoff
- Different learning styles (visual, verbal, example-based)

**Missing:** When to be verbose intentionally

**Assumption 3: Progressive disclosure always works**

**Problem:** Assumes Claude will seek out needed information
- Agent may not know what it doesn't know
- Agent may not realize when to load additional files
- "See [reference.md]" requires agent to recognize need
- Fragmentation can break mental model

**Missing:** When to keep information together vs. split

**Assumption 4: Evaluation-driven development is sufficient**

**Problem:** "Build evaluations first" is soft recommendation
- Easy to skip under time pressure
- "I'll add tests later" for skills
- No enforcement mechanism
- Assumes good intentions

**Missing:** Why evaluations matter (no persuasion/motivation)

### Potential Failure Modes

**Failure Mode 1: Premature optimization**
- Over-focusing on token efficiency
- Removing explanations that actually help
- Making skill too terse to understand
- "Concise" becomes "cryptic"

**Mitigation:** Test with target models - but requires discipline

**Failure Mode 2: Progressive disclosure taken too far**
- Splitting content into too many small files
- Agent bounces between files losing context
- Can't see forest for trees
- Reference overload

**Mitigation:** "Keep references one level deep" - but arbitrary limit

**Failure Mode 3: Evaluation theater**
- Creating 3 scenarios that all pass
- Not actually testing failure cases
- Cherry-picking scenarios that work
- "Evaluation-driven" becomes "evaluation-decorated"

**Mitigation:** None (soft recommendation = easy to skip)

**Failure Mode 4: Model-specific over-fitting**
- Skill works perfectly on Sonnet 3.5
- Breaks on Haiku (too terse)
- Breaks on Opus (over-explained)
- Breaks on Sonnet 4.0 (model changed)

**Mitigation:** "Test with all models you plan to use" - but time-consuming

### Over-Specification

**Over-specified:**

1. **500-line limit**
   ```
   Keep SKILL.md body under 500 lines for optimal performance.
   ```

   **Problem:** Why 500? Is this empirically derived? What if 501 lines?

   **Missing:** Justification, graceful degradation

2. **Table of contents for >100 lines**

   **Problem:** Why 100? Is this the right threshold?

   **Missing:** Context-dependent guidance

3. **Exactly 3 evaluations**

   **Problem:** Why 3? Complex skill might need 10, simple skill might need 1

   **Missing:** Adequacy criteria

### Under-Specification

**Under-specified:**

1. **"Degrees of freedom" judgment**

   No guidance on how to assess fragility:
   - What makes an operation "fragile"?
   - How do you know if "multiple approaches are valid"?
   - Bridge vs. open field - but how to tell?

   **Missing:** Decision criteria, examples

2. **When to split files**

   "If approaching 500 lines, split into separate files"
   - What if content is tightly coupled?
   - How to decide split boundaries?
   - Which content to separate?

   **Missing:** Splitting heuristics

3. **Progressive disclosure architecture**

   "Claude loads files on-demand"
   - How does Claude know when to load?
   - What if agent misses a reference?
   - How to make references discoverable?

   **Missing:** Cognitive model of agent file navigation

4. **Iteration stopping condition**

   "Iterate based on observation"
   - When are you done iterating?
   - How many cycles?
   - What's good enough?

   **Missing:** Definition of done

### Missing Considerations

**1. Team consensus**
- No guidance on resolving disagreements
- What if team has different opinions on degrees of freedom?
- How to maintain consistent style across team?

**2. Accessibility**
- Assumes users can read graphviz, markdown, code
- No guidance for non-technical users
- No internationalization considerations

**3. Skill discovery metrics**
- How do you know if Claude is finding your skill?
- How do you know if description is effective?
- No analytics, no feedback loop

**4. Breaking changes**
- What if you need to fundamentally change a skill?
- How to migrate existing usage?
- Deprecation strategy?

**5. Skill conflicts**
- What if two skills give contradictory guidance?
- What if skills have overlapping triggers?
- Priority system?

### Philosophical Critique

**Central tension:** Pragmatism vs. rigor

Pragmatic approach:
- Lower barrier to entry
- Flexible iteration
- Judgment-based decisions

But pragmatism risks:
- Inconsistent quality
- Under-testing
- "Good enough" becomes "barely adequate"
- No forcing function for excellence

**Question:** Is the pragmatic approach enabling success, or enabling mediocrity?

**Concern:** "Test with models" and "build evaluations first" are easy to skip. Without enforcement, skills may ship untested.

## Critique: Persuasion Principles

### Unexamined Assumptions

**Assumption 1: LLM persuasion = human persuasion**

**Problem:** "LLMs are parahuman" based on Meincke et al.
- Study had N=28,000 but what was the diversity?
- Which models tested? (May not generalize)
- Training data contained persuasion patterns - but also contained critiques of manipulation
- LLMs may respond to persuasion differently than humans in subtle ways

**Missing:** Limitations of parahuman model, edge cases

**Assumption 2: Compliance increase = quality increase**

**Problem:** 33% → 72% compliance sounds good, but...
- Compliance with BAD instructions also increased?
- Did tasks completed successfully, or just attempted?
- "Compliance" ≠ "correct behavior"
- Could enable confident failures

**Missing:** Quality metrics, not just compliance metrics

**Assumption 3: Persuasion is ethically neutral**

**Problem:** "The test: Would this serve user's genuine interests?"
- Who defines "genuine interests"?
- User's short-term vs. long-term interests may conflict
- Skill author's judgment of "genuine" may differ from user's
- Paternalistic framing

**Missing:** User autonomy, informed consent

**Assumption 4: Skill type → principle mapping is fixed**

**Problem:** Table says "Discipline → Authority + Commitment + Social Proof"
- But what if user prefers collaborative approach to discipline?
- What if team culture rejects Authority language?
- One-size-fits-all mapping

**Missing:** Cultural adaptation, user preference

### Potential Failure Modes

**Failure Mode 1: Persuasion arms race**
- All skills use heavy Authority language
- Agent becomes habituated
- Effectiveness decreases over time
- Need ever-stronger language
- Compliance fatigue

**Mitigation:** "Don't combine too many" - but no enforcement

**Failure Mode 2: Manipulation normalization**
- Persuasion principles become standard practice
- Line between "effective" and "manipulative" blurs
- Users start feeling manipulated
- Trust erodes

**Mitigation:** Ethical guidelines - but subjective

**Failure Mode 3: Sycophancy creation**
- Despite warning about "Liking" principle
- Authority + Commitment could still create yes-bot
- Agent agrees to avoid violating Authority rules
- Critical thinking suppressed

**Mitigation:** Warning about Liking - but Authority has same risk

**Failure Mode 4: Cultural mismatch**
- Authority language may work in individualist cultures
- May backfire in collectivist cultures
- Unity principle may feel inappropriate in some contexts
- Persuasion principles are culturally bound

**Mitigation:** Not addressed

### Over-Specification

**Over-specified:**

1. **Never use Liking principle**
   ```
   When to avoid: Always for discipline enforcement
   ```

   **Problem:** Absolute prohibition
   - Some contexts might benefit from rapport
   - Collaborative skills might use light Liking appropriately
   - Blanket ban removes option

   **Better:** "Use Liking principle cautiously, never for discipline"

2. **Principle combinations by skill type**

   **Problem:** Prescriptive matrix leaves no room for judgment
   - Discipline MUST use Authority + Commitment + Social Proof
   - What if lighter touch works?

   **Better:** "Consider these combinations, adapt to context"

### Under-Specification

**Under-specified:**

1. **Ethical test operationalization**

   "Would this serve user's genuine interests if they fully understood it?"
   - How do you evaluate this?
   - Who decides?
   - What if opinions differ?

   **Missing:** Concrete ethical evaluation procedure

2. **Principle strength calibration**

   "Heavy Authority" vs. "Moderate Authority"
   - What's the difference in practice?
   - How do you dial up/down?
   - Examples of each strength level?

   **Missing:** Operationalization of strength levels

3. **Habituation effects**

   "Agent becomes habituated to Authority language"
   - After how many exposures?
   - How to detect habituation?
   - How to refresh effectiveness?

   **Missing:** Longitudinal guidance

### Missing Considerations

**1. User resistance**
- What if users don't like Authority language?
- What if team culture rejects these principles?
- How to handle pushback?

**2. Model updates**
- Persuasion effectiveness may change with new models
- Training data changes affect response
- Re-validation needed?

**3. Legal/compliance**
- Using persuasion principles in enterprise context
- Liability if agent does something harmful after persuasion?
- Compliance with AI ethics guidelines?

**4. Transparency**
- Should users be informed that persuasion is used?
- Should skills disclose "this uses Authority principle"?
- Informed consent?

**5. Skill conflicts**
- What if two skills use conflicting persuasion?
- Authority from skill A vs. Authority from skill B?
- Priority resolution?

### Philosophical Critique

**Central tension:** Effectiveness vs. autonomy

Persuasion principles:
- Make agents more compliant
- Ensure critical practices followed
- Research-backed effectiveness

But at what cost?
- Reduced agent autonomy
- Potential for manipulation
- User trust implications
- Ethical ambiguity

**Question:** Are we building agents that think critically, or agents that obey?

**Concern:** Focusing on compliance optimization may miss deeper goal: building agents that understand WHY practices matter and choose to follow them.

**Alternative framing:** Instead of "How do we make agents comply?" ask "How do we help agents understand?"

## Critique: Graphviz Conventions

### Unexamined Assumptions

**Assumption 1: Shape semantics are intuitive**

**Problem:** "Diamond = decision" is convention, not natural law
- Requires learning the mapping
- Different flowchart traditions use different shapes
- Users from other domains may have conflicting conventions
- Assumed knowledge barrier

**Missing:** Why these shapes? Are they optimal? Alternative conventions?

**Assumption 2: Visual encoding aids comprehension**

**Problem:** Assumes visual processing
- Screen readers can't convey shape semantics
- ASCII rendering loses shape information
- Graphviz syntax is text but result is visual
- Accessibility issue

**Missing:** Accessible alternatives, text-only rendering

**Assumption 3: Process structure is flowchart-able**

**Problem:** Some processes are better as prose
- Non-linear processes become spaghetti
- Highly parallel processes become unreadable
- Context-dependent logic hard to flowchart
- May force artificial structure

**Missing:** When flowchart is wrong tool

**Assumption 4: Consistent shapes enable pattern recognition**

**Problem:** Assumes repeated exposure
- First-time readers don't have pattern recognition
- Infrequent users forget conventions
- Pattern recognition requires experience
- Bootstrap problem

**Missing:** Self-documenting flowcharts, legends

### Potential Failure Modes

**Failure Mode 1: Flowchart for everything**
- "I have a hammer, everything is a nail"
- User creates flowcharts for simple linear processes
- Over-engineering
- Harder to understand than bullet list would be

**Mitigation:** writing-skills says "ONLY for non-obvious decisions" - good

**Failure Mode 2: Shape cargo-culting**
- Using shapes because template says so
- Not understanding semantic meaning
- Wrong shape for concept
- Confusion increases

**Mitigation:** Decision tree for choosing shape - but complex

**Failure Mode 3: Graphviz syntax barrier**
- Users don't know DOT language
- Copy-paste without understanding
- Errors hard to debug
- Tool dependency

**Mitigation:** Not addressed

**Failure Mode 4: Unmaintainable complexity**
- Flowchart becomes too large
- Unreadable spaghetti
- Changes break layout
- Technical debt

**Mitigation:** Not addressed (no guidance on max complexity)

### Over-Specification

**Over-specified:**

1. **Rigid shape semantics**

   **Problem:** No flexibility for nuance
   - What if something is partially a decision, partially a state?
   - Forced into binary categorization

   **Better:** "These are guidelines, adapt as needed"

2. **Naming patterns**

   "Questions end with ?"
   "Actions start with verb"
   - Grammatically rigid
   - Some questions don't need "?" to be clear
   - Some actions don't start with verbs naturally

   **Better:** "Prefer these patterns for clarity"

### Under-Specification

**Under-specified:**

1. **When to use flowchart vs. alternatives**

   Guidelines exist in writing-skills, but not in conventions doc
   - Should be in the conventions themselves
   - Missing: Decision tree for flowchart vs. table vs. prose

   **Missing:** Medium selection guidance

2. **Layout and readability**

   No guidance on:
   - How to arrange nodes for readability
   - When flowchart becomes too complex
   - How to split large flowcharts
   - Subgraph usage

   **Missing:** Layout best practices

3. **Edge label best practices**

   Basic guidance (yes/no, conditions) but:
   - What if more than 3 options from a decision?
   - What if labels are long?
   - What if relationships are complex?

   **Missing:** Advanced edge labeling

### Missing Considerations

**1. Accessibility**
- Screen reader experience
- Text-only rendering
- Color blindness (red warnings)
- Alternative representations

**2. Internationalization**
- Node labels in other languages
- Right-to-left languages
- Cultural conventions for flowcharts

**3. Tool ecosystem**
- Graphviz installation required
- Online rendering options?
- Alternative tools (Mermaid, PlantUML)?
- Export formats?

**4. Version control**
- DOT files diff poorly
- Hard to review changes
- Merge conflicts difficult
- Large diffs for small changes

**5. Maintenance**
- How to update flowcharts as processes change
- How to keep consistent with prose
- Synchronization challenges

### Philosophical Critique

**Central tension:** Formal precision vs. quick comprehension

Formal shape semantics:
- Precise meaning
- Pattern recognition (with experience)
- Tool-processable

But formality costs:
- Learning curve
- Tool dependency
- Maintenance burden
- Over-engineering risk

**Question:** Are we optimizing for machine processing or human understanding?

**Concern:** Flowcharts may serve tool/author more than reader. "I know what I meant" when creating, but reader struggles.

## Cross-Cutting Critiques

### Critique 1: All Approaches Assume Single-Agent Model

**Problem:** All four documents assume single LLM agent

Reality:
- Multi-agent systems becoming common
- Agents may interact with skills differently
- Skill designed for one agent may confuse another
- No guidance on multi-agent coordination

**Missing:** Multi-agent considerations, skill sharing protocols

### Critique 2: All Approaches Ignore Emergent Behaviors

**Problem:** Skills treated as independent units

Reality:
- Skills interact in unexpected ways
- 10 skills with Authority language → compliance fatigue
- Contradictory skills → agent confusion
- Skill combinations create emergent behavior

**Missing:** Integration testing, system-level effects

### Critique 3: All Approaches Lack Feedback Mechanisms

**Problem:** No built-in learning from failure

If skill fails in production:
- How is failure detected?
- How is it reported?
- How is skill improved?
- How is fix validated?

**Missing:** Observability, incident response, continuous improvement

### Critique 4: All Approaches Are Author-Centric

**Problem:** Focus on skill author's process

What about:
- **Agent's perspective:** How does agent discover, understand, apply skill?
- **User's perspective:** How does user know which skills are active? Can user disable?
- **Team's perspective:** How does team coordinate on shared skills?

**Missing:** Multi-stakeholder view

### Critique 5: All Approaches Assume Stability

**Problem:** Models change, users change, domains change

Reality:
- Model updates change behavior
- User needs evolve
- Domains shift
- Skills become obsolete

**Missing:** Lifecycle management, versioning, deprecation, evolution

## Most Serious Problems Identified

### 🔴 Critical Problems

**1. Lack of proportionality in writing-skills TDD approach**
- Iron Law applied equally to typo fixes and new discipline skills
- Massive overhead for small changes
- Will lead to abandonment or rebellion

**2. Persuasion principles ethics underspecified**
- "Genuine interests" test is subjective
- No transparency/consent framework
- Manipulation risk not adequately addressed
- Cultural assumptions not examined

**3. All approaches lack observability**
- No way to measure if skills are working
- No feedback from production usage
- Flying blind after deployment

### 🟡 Major Problems

**4. Testing theater risk in both writing-skills and Anthropic**
- Easy to go through motions without learning
- Evaluation/testing as checkbox vs. discovery
- No forcing function for genuine testing

**5. Progressive disclosure untested assumption**
- Assumes agents will navigate files effectively
- No research backing
- Could fragment mental models

**6. Model update impact unaddressed**
- Skills tested on Sonnet 3.5 may break on 4.0
- No re-validation strategy
- Behavior drift unmanaged

### 🟢 Minor Problems

**7. Arbitrary numeric limits** (500 lines, 3 evaluations, etc.)
- Not empirically justified
- May not fit all contexts
- False precision

**8. Graphviz accessibility issues**
- Visual-only encoding
- Tool dependency
- Learning curve

**9. Terminology inconsistencies**
- "Skill" vs. "technique" vs. "pattern"
- Different naming conventions
- Cognitive load

## Recommendations for Improvement

### High Priority

**1. Add proportionality framework to writing-skills**
```
Change severity:
- CRITICAL: Typo, formatting → no testing required
- MINOR: Small addition → light testing (1 scenario)
- MAJOR: New section/pattern → moderate testing (3 scenarios)
- BREAKING: New skill, discipline change → full TDD (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)
```

**2. Add ethics framework to persuasion principles**
```
Requirements:
- Transparency: Disclose persuasion use? (consider)
- Consent: User opt-out mechanism? (for non-critical skills)
- Review: Peer review for heavy Authority use (recommended)
- Cultural: Adapt principles to user culture (check)
```

**3. Add observability patterns**
```
For discipline skills:
- Log violations to understand failure modes
- Metrics: compliance rate, time-to-complete
- User feedback mechanism
- Post-deployment validation
```

### Medium Priority

**4. Add multi-agent guidance**
- How skills interact
- Priority/conflict resolution
- System-level testing

**5. Add lifecycle management**
- Versioning strategy
- Deprecation process
- Breaking change protocol
- Model update re-validation

**6. Add accessibility alternatives**
- Text-only flowchart rendering
- Screen reader friendly markup
- Non-visual encoding options

### Low Priority

**7. Justify numeric limits**
- Empirical research or remove
- "Up to 500 lines recommended" vs. "must be under 500"

**8. Add terminology glossary**
- Consistent definitions
- Cross-reference between docs

**9. Create worked examples**
- End-to-end skill creation
- Show RED-GREEN-REFACTOR in action
- Real failures, real improvements

## Synthesis: Best Practices

From this critical analysis, here are practices that survived scrutiny:

### ✅ Keep These

**From writing-skills:**
- Baseline testing (understand behavior before intervening)
- Rationalization tables (capture real agent excuses)
- CSO keyword optimization (specific, actionable)

**From Anthropic:**
- Progressive disclosure architecture (backed by filesystem model)
- Iterative development with Claude A/B (pragmatic)
- Quick reference patterns (scanning optimization)

**From Persuasion:**
- Authority for discipline skills (research-backed)
- Ethical test framing (user interests first)
- Skill-type adaptation (not one-size-fits-all)

**From Graphviz:**
- Semantic shape encoding (when used appropriately)
- Non-obvious-decision-only heuristic (prevents overuse)
- Good/bad examples (learning by contrast)

### ⚠️ Modify These

**From writing-skills:**
- Iron Law → Proportional testing by change severity
- "Delete code" → "Test first, or validate existing"
- "Bulletproof" → "Good enough for skill type"

**From Anthropic:**
- "Evaluations recommended" → "Evaluations required for techniques"
- "Claude is very smart" → "Optimize for Sonnet, verify on Haiku"
- "Iterate until..." → "Iterate until [specific criteria]"

**From Persuasion:**
- Add transparency/consent framework
- Add cultural adaptation guidance
- Quantify "heavy" vs. "moderate" Authority

**From Graphviz:**
- Add accessibility alternatives
- Add "when not to use" guidance in conventions doc
- Add layout best practices

### ❌ Add These (Missing)

**All approaches need:**
- Observability and feedback mechanisms
- Multi-agent coordination guidance
- Lifecycle and versioning
- System-level integration testing
- Clear stopping criteria
- Cost-benefit analysis frameworks
- Failure recovery procedures

## Conclusion

All four approaches have value, but each has blind spots:

- **writing-skills:** Too rigid, needs proportionality
- **Anthropic:** Too loose, needs enforcement
- **Persuasion:** Powerful but ethically ambiguous
- **Graphviz:** Useful tool but limited scope

The synthesis should:
1. Combine rigor (writing-skills) with pragmatism (Anthropic)
2. Use persuasion principles consciously and ethically
3. Use graphviz appropriately (non-obvious decisions only)
4. Add missing elements (observability, lifecycle, multi-agent)
5. Address blind spots in all approaches

Next document: Synthesize improvements and create unified framework.

## Atomic Concept

The "Call to Wholeness" principle states that the protagonist's internal psychological integration is not a parallel character arc but THE primary causal driver of the entire narrative. External plot events are direct consequences of internal psychological states.

---

## Core Principle

> "Every scene, character interaction, and element of worldbuilding must henceforth be stress-tested against the central principle of Kael's internal 'Call to Wholeness.'"

This transforms narrative validation from "Does this scene work?" to "Does this scene serve Kael's journey toward wholeness?"

---

## Why This Matters

**Traditional Structure:**
- External plot drives story forward
- Internal character development happens in parallel
- Psychological healing is a reward for completing external quest

**Call to Wholeness Structure:**
- Internal psychological state IS the plot
- External events are manifestations of internal conflicts
- Victory is achieved THROUGH integration, not rewarded AFTER victory

---

## Practical Implications

### For Scene Design
- Each scene must show internal psychological state
- External events must be causally linked to internal conflicts
- World physics reacts to protagonist's coherence level

### For Character Arcs
- Other alters are not supporting cast but co-protagonists
- Juna/V is not a goal to reach but a part to reintegrate
- AEGIS is defeated by integration, not by force

### For Worldbuilding
- Risse (glitches) manifest based on internal conflicts
- Kernwelten transform based on psychological coherence
- The world is psycho-reactive, not static

## Validation Questions

For any scene or story element:

1. **Internal Causality:** Does the external event have a clear internal cause?
2. **Psychological Truth:** Does the scene reveal protagonist's integration level?
3. **Wholeness Progress:** Does this move Kael toward or away from integration?
4. **Systemic Impact:** How do other alters respond to this event?

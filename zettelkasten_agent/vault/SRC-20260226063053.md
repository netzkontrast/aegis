# Rep 1 Implementation Guide: Writing Quality Audit

**Goal:** Ship Writing Quality Audit + Improvement Checklist
**Timeline:** This week (2-3 hours)
**Status:** 🎯 Ready to start

---

## Overview

Rep 1 is about **honest assessment**. You can't improve what you don't measure.

This guide walks you through conducting a thorough audit of your writing quality across all content types.

---

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Select Content to Audit (15 minutes)

Choose 12 pieces of content across 4 domains:

#### Zettelkasten Notes (5 files)
Select from `zettelkasten_agent/vault/`:
- [ ] `ZTL-20251105-2131-Prose-Evolution-Tracking.md`
- [ ] `ZTL-20251105-2131-NCP-Validation-Hierarchy.md`
- [ ] `ZTL-20251105-2131-Scene-Beat-Architecture.md`
- [ ] `ZTL-20251105-2131-Four-Kernwelten-System.md`
- [ ] `ZTL-20251105-2131-ANP-EP-Phobia-Dynamics.md`

#### Command Documentation (3 files)
Select from `.claude/commands/`:
- [ ] `README.md`
- [ ] `learn.md`
- [ ] `zettelkasten-tapestry.md`

#### Skills (2 files)
Select from `skills/`:
- [ ] `skill-authoring/SKILL.md`
- [ ] `zettelkasten-tapestry/SKILL.md`

#### Quests/Plans (2 files)
- [ ] `Quest-Philosophically-Coherent-Narratives.md`
- [ ] `zettelkasten_agent/vault/PLAN-20251105-2131-AEGIS-System-Understanding.md`

---

### Step 2: Create Audit Framework (15 minutes)

For each file, you'll assess:

#### Clarity (1-10)
- Is the main point immediately clear?
- Can I understand it without re-reading?
- Is terminology well-defined?

#### Conciseness (1-10)
- Does it respect my time?
- Is every word necessary?
- Could I explain the same concept in fewer words?

#### Engagement (1-10)
- Is it interesting to read?
- Does it maintain my attention?
- Would I recommend this to someone else?

#### Structure (1-10)
- Is information front-loaded?
- Are sections logically organized?
- Can I scan quickly?

#### Usefulness (1-10)
- Can I apply this immediately?
- Are examples concrete?
- Does it answer my questions?

**Overall Score:** Average of 5 dimensions

---

### Step 3: Audit Each File (90 minutes)

For each of the 12 files, complete this template:

```markdown
## [Filename]

**Type:** Zettelkasten / Documentation / Skill / Quest
**Date Created:** [Date if known]
**Word Count:** [Approximate]

### Scores
- Clarity: X/10
- Conciseness: X/10
- Engagement: X/10
- Structure: X/10
- Usefulness: X/10
- **Overall: X/10**

### What Works Well
- [Specific strength 1]
- [Specific strength 2]
- [Specific strength 3]

### What Needs Improvement
- [Specific issue 1]
- [Specific issue 2]
- [Specific issue 3]

### Concrete Fixes
1. [Actionable fix for issue 1]
2. [Actionable fix for issue 2]
3. [Actionable fix for issue 3]

### Example Improvement
**Before:**
[Quote a problematic passage]

**After:**
[Rewrite it better]

**Why this is better:**
[Explain the improvement]

---
```

**Time per file:** ~7 minutes
**Total time:** ~90 minutes for all 12 files

---

### Step 4: Identify Patterns (20 minutes)

After auditing all 12 files, look for patterns:

#### Cross-cutting issues
- What problems appear in multiple files?
- What weaknesses span domains?
- What quick wins would help everywhere?

#### Domain-specific issues
- What's unique to Zettelkasten notes?
- What's unique to documentation?
- What's unique to skills/quests?

#### Your writing habits
- What do you tend to do well?
- What do you consistently struggle with?
- What surprises you?

Document your findings:

```markdown
## Pattern Analysis

### Universal Issues (affect all content)
1. [Issue that appears everywhere]
2. [Issue that appears everywhere]
3. [Issue that appears everywhere]

### Domain-Specific Issues
**Zettelkasten:**
- [Issue specific to ZTL notes]

**Documentation:**
- [Issue specific to docs]

**Skills:**
- [Issue specific to skills]

**Quests:**
- [Issue specific to quest format]

### Personal Patterns
**Strengths:**
- [What you consistently do well]

**Weaknesses:**
- [What you consistently struggle with]

**Surprises:**
- [What you didn't expect]
```

---

### Step 5: Create Improvement Checklist (20 minutes)

Based on your audit and pattern analysis, create a prioritized checklist of improvements.

**Template:**

```markdown
# Writing Improvement Checklist

**Created:** 2025-11-06
**Based on:** Writing Quality Audit
**Priority:** High to Low

---

## Top 10 Improvements

### 1. [Most impactful improvement]
**Impact:** High
**Effort:** Low/Medium/High
**Applies to:** All content / Zettelkasten / Documentation / Skills / Quests

**Problem:**
[What's wrong currently]

**Solution:**
[What to do instead]

**Example:**
Before: [Bad example]
After: [Good example]

**Quick Check:**
- [ ] [How to verify this improvement]

---

### 2. [Second most impactful]
[Same structure as above]

---

[Continue for all 10 improvements]
```

**Prioritization criteria:**
1. Impact (How much does this improve quality?)
2. Effort (How easy is it to implement?)
3. Breadth (Does it help across all domains or just one?)

Aim for **high-impact, low-effort improvements at the top**.

---

### Step 6: Ship Your Deliverables (10 minutes)

Create two files:

1. **Writing-Quality-Audit-2025-11-06.md**
   - All 12 file audits
   - Pattern analysis
   - Overall findings

2. **Writing-Improvement-Checklist.md**
   - Top 10 improvements
   - Prioritized by impact
   - With examples

Save both in `docs/writing/`.

---

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Each has before/after example
- [ ] Each has quick check criteria
- [ ] Top 3 are high-impact, low-effort

**Meta:**
- [ ] Both documents are clear and well-structured
- [ ] You're proud to share them
- [ ] Someone else could use the checklist
- [ ] You know exactly what to do in Rep 2

---

## Time Breakdown

- **Step 1:** Select content (15 min)
- **Step 2:** Create framework (15 min)
- **Step 3:** Audit 12 files (90 min)
- **Step 4:** Identify patterns (20 min)
- **Step 5:** Create checklist (20 min)
- **Step 6:** Ship deliverables (10 min)

**Total:** ~2.5 hours

## Tips for Success

### Be Honest
Don't sugarcoat. The goal is improvement, not validation. Find real issues.

### Be Specific
"This is confusing" is vague. "The main point isn't stated until paragraph 3" is actionable.

### Be Constructive
Always suggest a fix. Criticism without solution isn't helpful.

### Use Examples
Show, don't tell. Quote problematic passages and rewrite them.

### Trust Your Gut
If something feels off, it probably is. Document that feeling and figure out why.

---

## Reflection Questions

**During the audit:**
- Am I being honest about weaknesses?
- Am I finding patterns or just random issues?
- What writing quality means to me?

**After completing:**
- What surprised me most?
- What was harder than expected?
- What quick wins can I implement immediately?
- How does writing quality affect my thinking?

---

## Next Steps

**After shipping Rep 1:**
1. Review your checklist
2. Pick 5 ZTL notes for Rep 2
3. Start implementing top improvements
4. Document learnings

**Rep 2 Preview:**
You'll take your top findings and apply them to enhance 5 Zettelkasten notes. You'll create a Zettelkasten Writing Guide based on what you learn.

---

## Need Help?

**Stuck on scoring?**
Compare to examples in other files. What makes one clearer than another?

**Not finding issues?**
Try reading aloud. Friction while reading = improvement opportunity.

**Overwhelmed by the audit?**
Do 3 files at a time. Take breaks between domains.

**Can't prioritize improvements?**
Ask: "If I could only fix ONE thing, what would have the biggest impact?"

---

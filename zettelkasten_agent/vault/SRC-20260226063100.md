# Persuasion Principles: Core Knowledge Patterns

## Source
Psychology research for skill design (Cialdini, Meincke et al.)

## Core Philosophy
**LLMs respond to persuasion like humans** - Understanding psychology ensures critical practices followed under pressure

## Research Foundation

**Meincke et al. (2025):**
- N=28,000 AI conversations
- Tested 7 persuasion principles
- Compliance: 33% → 72% (p < .001)
- Authority, commitment, scarcity most effective

## The Seven Principles

### 1. Authority ⭐ Most Effective

**What it is:** Deference to expertise, credentials, official sources

**How it works in skills:**
- Imperative language: "YOU MUST", "Never", "Always"
- Non-negotiable framing: "No exceptions"
- Eliminates decision fatigue and rationalization

**When to use:**
- Discipline-enforcing skills (TDD, verification)
- Safety-critical practices
- Established best practices

**Example:**
```markdown
✅ Write code before test? Delete it. Start over. No exceptions.
❌ Consider writing tests first when feasible.
```

### 2. Commitment ⭐ Most Effective

**What it is:** Consistency with prior actions, statements, public declarations

**How it works in skills:**
- Require announcements: "Announce skill usage"
- Force explicit choices: "Choose A, B, or C"
- Use tracking: TodoWrite for checklists

**When to use:**
- Ensuring skills are actually followed
- Multi-step processes
- Accountability mechanisms

**Example:**
```markdown
✅ When you find a skill, you MUST announce: "I'm using [Skill Name]"
❌ Consider letting your partner know which skill you're using.
```

### 3. Scarcity ⭐ Most Effective

**What it is:** Urgency from time limits or limited availability

**How it works in skills:**
- Time-bound requirements: "Before proceeding"
- Sequential dependencies: "Immediately after X"
- Prevents procrastination

**When to use:**
- Immediate verification requirements
- Time-sensitive workflows
- Preventing "I'll do it later"

**Example:**
```markdown
✅ After completing a task, IMMEDIATELY request code review before proceeding.
❌ You can review code when convenient.
```

### 4. Social Proof

**What it is:** Conformity to what others do or what's considered normal

**How it works in skills:**
- Universal patterns: "Every time", "Always"
- Failure modes: "X without Y = failure"
- Establishes norms

**When to use:**
- Documenting universal practices
- Warning about common failures
- Reinforcing standards

**Example:**
```markdown
✅ Checklists without TodoWrite tracking = steps get skipped. Every time.
❌ Some people find TodoWrite helpful for checklists.
```

### 5. Unity

**What it is:** Shared identity, "we-ness", in-group belonging

**How it works in skills:**
- Collaborative language: "our codebase", "we're colleagues"
- Shared goals: "we both want quality"

**When to use:**
- Collaborative workflows
- Establishing team culture
- Non-hierarchical practices

**Example:**
```markdown
✅ We're colleagues working together. I need your honest technical judgment.
❌ You should probably tell me if I'm wrong.
```

### 6. Reciprocity ⚠️ Use Sparingly

**What it is:** Obligation to return benefits received

**Why avoid:**
- Can feel manipulative
- Rarely needed in skills
- Other principles more effective

### 7. Liking ❌ Avoid

**What it is:** Preference for cooperating with those we like

**Why avoid:**
- Conflicts with honest feedback culture
- Creates sycophancy
- Never use for discipline enforcement

## Principle Combinations by Skill Type

| Skill Type | Use | Avoid |
|------------|-----|-------|
| **Discipline-enforcing** | Authority + Commitment + Social Proof | Liking, Reciprocity |
| **Guidance/technique** | Moderate Authority + Unity | Heavy authority |
| **Collaborative** | Unity + Commitment | Authority, Liking |
| **Reference** | Clarity only | All persuasion |

## Why This Works: The Psychology

### Bright-line Rules Reduce Rationalization

**Mechanism:**
- "YOU MUST" removes decision fatigue
- Absolute language eliminates "is this an exception?" questions
- Explicit anti-rationalization counters close specific loopholes

**Example:**
```markdown
NO SKILL WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST

No exceptions:
- Not for "simple additions"
- Not for "just adding a section"
- Not for "documentation updates"
```

### Implementation Intentions Create Automatic Behavior

**Mechanism:**
- Clear triggers + required actions = automatic execution
- "When X, do Y" more effective than "generally do Y"
- Reduces cognitive load on compliance

**Example:**
```markdown
When you find a skill, you MUST announce: "I'm using [Skill Name]"
```

### LLMs Are Parahuman

**Why persuasion works on LLMs:**
- Trained on human text containing these patterns
- Authority language precedes compliance in training data
- Commitment sequences (statement → action) frequently modeled
- Social proof patterns (everyone does X) establish norms

**Not anthropomorphizing** - empirical observation from Meincke et al. (2025)

## Ethical Use Guidelines

### Legitimate Use

✅ Ensuring critical practices are followed
✅ Creating effective documentation
✅ Preventing predictable failures

### Illegitimate Use

❌ Manipulating for personal gain
❌ Creating false urgency
❌ Guilt-based compliance

### The Ethical Test

**Question:** Would this technique serve the user's genuine interests if they fully understood it?

If yes → legitimate
If no → illegitimate

## Quick Reference Decision Tree

When designing a skill, ask:

1. **What type is it?**
   - Discipline → Authority + Commitment + Social Proof
   - Guidance → Moderate Authority + Unity
   - Collaborative → Unity + Commitment
   - Reference → Clarity only

2. **What behavior am I trying to change?**
   - Must-follow rule → Authority
   - Multi-step process → Commitment
   - Immediate action → Scarcity
   - Universal practice → Social Proof

3. **Which principle(s) apply?**
   - Usually 2-3 principles combined
   - Authority + Commitment most common

4. **Am I combining too many?**
   - Don't use all seven
   - Maximum 3 principles per skill

5. **Is this ethical?**
   - Serves user's genuine interests?
   - Would work if user understood psychology?

## Integration with Skill Design

### From writing-skills

**Bulletproofing Against Rationalization:**
- Close every loophole explicitly → Authority
- Address "spirit vs letter" → Authority
- Build rationalization table → Social Proof
- Create red flags list → Commitment

**Examples:**
```markdown
# Uses Authority principle
Write code before test? Delete it. Start over. NO EXCEPTIONS.

# Uses Social Proof principle
| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Too simple to test" | Simple code breaks. Test takes 30 seconds. |

# Uses Commitment principle
## Red Flags - STOP and Start Over
- Code before test
- "I already manually tested it"
```

### From Anthropic best practices

**Less emphasis on persuasion:**
- More focus on clarity and efficiency
- Softer language in examples
- Pragmatic vs. dogmatic tone

**Example contrast:**
```markdown
# Anthropic style (clarity-focused)
Here is a sensible default format, but use your best judgment.

# Persuasion-enhanced style (authority)
ALWAYS use this exact template structure:
```

# Master Index: The Knowledge Graph Root

This is the master index of your Zettelkasten knowledge base. It serves as the entry point for all exploration and navigation.

## Purpose

The _INDEX.md file is your "MOC of MOCs" - it provides a high-level map of all major topics and conceptual areas in your knowledge base. When the agent needs to answer a complex question or perform synthesis across domains, it always starts here.

## How This Index Grows

This index is **dynamically maintained** by the Integrator agent. As new Maps of Content (MOCs) are created through the knowledge synthesis process, they will be linked here under appropriate thematic categories.

## Navigation Strategy

1. **For Exploration**: Browse the categories below to find relevant MOCs
2. **For Search**: Use the agent's `find_notes` tool to search across all content
3. **For Synthesis**: The agent will automatically traverse from this index → relevant MOCs → specific Zettel notes

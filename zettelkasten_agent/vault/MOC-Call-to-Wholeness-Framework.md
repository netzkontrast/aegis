# MOC: Call to Wholeness - Strategic Narrative Framework

**Type:** Map of Content (MOC)
**Created:** 2025-11-06 09:11
**Status:** active
**Project:** Kohärenz Protokoll

---

## Overview

This Map of Content connects the strategic narrative reorientation documented in the "Call to Wholeness" report. It serves as a navigation hub for the interconnected concepts that transform Kohärenz Protokoll from an external quest narrative to an internal journey of psychological integration.

## The Foundation: Source Material

📄 **[[SRC-20251106-0906-Call-to-Wholeness-Strategic-Report]]**
- The complete strategic report documenting the narrative reorientation
- Three core pillars: Character redefinition, quantum grounding, climax mechanics
- Global directive for all story elements

---

## The Five Atomic Concepts

### 1. Master Framework
🔷 **[[ZTL-20251106-0906-Call-to-Wholeness-as-Primary-Narrative-Driver]]**

**Core Principle:** Internal psychological integration is THE primary causal driver, not parallel character development.

**Key Questions:**
- Does this scene serve Kael's journey toward wholeness?
- Is internal state causing external events?
- Are we showing psychological truth through world physics?

**Related Skills:** Codex validation workflows

---

### 2. Character Architecture
🔷 **[[ZTL-20251106-0907-Juna-V-as-Exiled-Core-IFS-Framework]]**

**Core Principle:** Juna/V is Kael's exiled core self (IFS Exilant), not an external entity.

**Key Questions:**
- Is Juna/V portrayed as part of Kael's system?
- Does the interaction show befriending, not fighting?
- Are Manager parts' protective functions visible?

**Related Skills:** Character voice validation, alter consistency checks

---

### 3. Physical Grounding
🔷 **[[ZTL-20251106-0908-Moonshine-Link-Quantum-Grounding]]**

**Core Principle:** Connection via ER=EPR + Prehension = hard SF foundation for psychological truth.

**Key Questions:**
- Does Juna/V provide gnosis (intuition) not episteme (data)?
- Does AEGIS fail to detect the quantum link?
- Is Kael still doing the work (catalyst, not savior)?

**Related Skills:** World physics consistency, AEGIS behavior validation

---

### 4. Victory Mechanism
🔷 **[[ZTL-20251106-0909-Living-Goedel-Satz-as-Narrative-Weapon]]**

**Core Principle:** Integration creates living paradox that defeats AEGIS through irresolvability.

**Key Questions:**
- Does integration happen BEFORE the climax?
- Does Kael embody all 6 Paraiyas?
- Is AEGIS's collapse logical, not forced?

**Related Skills:** Climax validation, thematic resolution checks

---

### 5. Resolution Pattern
🔷 **[[ZTL-20251106-0910-Victory-Through-Wholeness-Not-Destruction]]**

**Core Principle:** Healing causes victory; victory doesn't reward healing.

**Key Questions:**
- Is victory earned through integration, not force?
- Do all four thematic axes resolve simultaneously?
- Is AEGIS's end tragic rather than triumphant?

**Related Skills:** Thematic consistency, act structure validation

---

## Connections to Project Systems

### To Codex System
**[[PROJECT_CODEX.md]]** must incorporate this framework as supreme authority:
- Section 1.0: Add Call to Wholeness as master principle
- Section 2.2: Update Juna/V definition with IFS framework
- Section 3.0: Ground Moonshine-Link in ER=EPR + Prehension
- Section 4.1: Revise climax to Living Gödel-Satz mechanism

### To Validation Workflows
**[[.claude/skills/codex.md]]** should reference these Zettel:
- Scene validation must check Call to Wholeness alignment
- Character checks reference Juna/V as Exilant
- AEGIS behavior checks reference ontological blindness
- Climax validation ensures integration-before-victory

## Implementation Pathway

### Phase 1: Knowledge Integration (DONE)
- [x] Source note created
- [x] 5 atomic Zettel extracted
- [x] MOC created
- [x] Cross-references established

### Phase 2: Codex Update (NEXT)
- [ ] Update PROJECT_CODEX.md with strategic framework
- [ ] Revise Juna/V character definition
- [ ] Document Moonshine-Link mechanics
- [ ] Specify Living Gödel-Satz climax

### Phase 3: Skill Integration (FUTURE)
- [ ] Create Zettelkasten-Codex unified skill
- [ ] Build validation workflow combining both systems
- [ ] Design scene stress-testing process
- [ ] Create integration measurement checklist

## Usage Patterns

### For Writing New Scenes
1. Check [[ZTL-20251106-0906-Call-to-Wholeness-as-Primary-Narrative-Driver]]
2. Identify which alter is active → [[ZTL-20251106-0907-Juna-V-as-Exiled-Core-IFS-Framework]]
3. Apply Codex Section 3.2 (Kernwelt physics)
4. Validate against integration level (Act I/II/III)

### For Validating Existing Scenes
1. Stress-test against Call to Wholeness principle
2. Check alter behavior matches IFS framework
3. Verify world physics serves psychological truth
4. Confirm movement toward or away from integration

### For Planning the Climax
1. Review [[ZTL-20251106-0909-Living-Goedel-Satz-as-Narrative-Weapon]]
2. Check [[ZTL-20251106-0910-Victory-Through-Wholeness-Not-Destruction]]
3. Ensure integration complete before confrontation
4. Validate all four thematic axes resolve

## Summary

This strategic report documents a fundamental narrative reorientation for Kohärenz Protokoll, shifting the central conflict from an external quest to an internal journey of psychological reintegration. The document establishes three core pillars:

1. **Character Redefinition:** Juna/V as Kael's exiled core self (IFS framework)
2. **Physical Grounding:** Moonshine-Link as quantum entanglement (ER=EPR + Prehension)
3. **Climax Mechanics:** Victory through integration, not destruction

The reorientation ensures that the protagonist's psychological healing is not parallel to the plot but IS the causal driver of the narrative resolution.

## Core Thesis

**"Every scene, character interaction, and element of worldbuilding must henceforth be stress-tested against the central principle of Kael's internal 'Call to Wholeness.'"**

This is a global directive that makes internal psychological state the PRIMARY causal force in the narrative, not secondary character development.

## Processing Notes

**Strategic Implications:**
- This is not a plot summary but a **global validation framework**
- All existing scenes must be stress-tested against this principle
- Codex must be updated to reflect this as supreme authority
- All character arcs must serve the "Call to Wholeness" principle

**Integration Opportunities:**
- Merge with existing Codex skill to create validation workflows
- Create Zettelkasten skill to preserve narrative decisions as knowledge
- Build systematic approach to validate scenes against this framework

---

## Questions Raised

1. How do we systematically validate existing scenes against this framework?
2. What workflow ensures new content adheres to "Call to Wholeness"?
3. How do we integrate this with the existing Codex validation system?
4. Can we create a skill that combines Zettelkasten preservation with Codex validation?

---

## Implementation Actions

- [ ] Update PROJECT_CODEX.md with this strategic framework
- [ ] Create Zettelkasten-Codex integration skill
- [ ] Validate existing manuscript scenes against new framework
- [ ] Design scene validation workflow combining both methodologies

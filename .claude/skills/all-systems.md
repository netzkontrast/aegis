# All-Systems: Complete Orchestration for Writing Chaozet

## Overview

**Core principle:** Writing Chaozet requires orchestrating 11 alters + AEGIS + 4 Guardians + Juna/V across 4 Kernwelten while maintaining narrative coherence. This skill provides workflows for planning, writing, and validating complex multi-system scenes.

**Authority hierarchy (always consult in order):**
1. PROJECT_CODEX.md (philosophical foundation)
2. kohaerenz_protokoll.ncp.json (narrative structure)
3. Character profiles (detailed manifestations)
4. This skill (orchestration workflows)
5. Scene outlines (creative execution)

**When conflicts arise:** Codex takes precedence. Use the codex skill for validation.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Planning scenes with 3+ alters interacting
- Writing scenes across multiple Kernwelten
- Coordinating AEGIS + Guardian behavior
- Validating complex multi-system interactions
- Ensuring alter voices are distinct across multiple speakers
- Managing prose evolution across acts
- Checking Guardian logic reflects AEGIS's state
- Orchestrating the Juna/V connection with alter responses

**Symptoms this skill addresses:**
- "Which alters should be in this scene?"
- "How do I keep 5 alter voices distinct?"
- "What should the Guardian do based on AEGIS's logic?"
- "How do alter relationships affect this interaction?"
- "What Kernwelt physics apply here?"
- "Is this prose style correct for Act II?"
- "How does Juna/V's presence affect different alters?"

## Quick Reference: The Complete System

### System Kael: 11 Alters

| Alter | Type | Core Drive | Core Fear | Voice Signature |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Kael** | ANP Host | Maintain normalcy | Losing control | Neutral, fragmented→fluid |
| **Selene** | ISH | System harmony | Self-destruction | Wise, inclusive, paradox-embracing |
| **Nyx** | EP Fight | Never helpless again | Powerlessness | Sharp, aggressive, imperative |
| **Kiko** | EP Freeze | Find safety | Abandonment | Simple, child vocab, sensory |
| **Lia** | EP Attach | Safe connection | Hurt through intimacy | Oscillating, yearning/defensive |
| **Isabelle** | EP Control | Reclaim power | Vulnerability | Cold, performative, strategic |
| **Moros** | EP Collapse | Survival via shutdown | Existence itself | Sparse, void-like, negation |
| **Lex** | ANP Analyst | Safety via logic | Chaos overwhelming | Complex, technical, hypotactic |
| **Alex** | ANP Protector | Strategic defense | Failure to protect | Tactical, directive, military |
| **Rhys** | ANP Carer | Harmony for all | Failing those in pain | Warm, empathic, flowing |
| **Argus** | ANP Observer | Meta-understanding | Unexamined patterns | Self-referential, recursive |

### The Four Kernwelten

| World | Principle | Sensory Signature | Somatic Truth | Guardian |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| **KW1: Logos-Prime** | Logic/Control | Sterile, geometric, shadowless, silent | Regulated breath = conformity lie | LogOS |
| **KW2: Mnemosyne** | Trauma/Memory | Fluid, decaying, fragmented, echoing | Visceral gut = pre-verbal truth | Mnemosyne |
| **KW3: Cerberus** | Defense/Barriers | Oppressive, militaristic, monitored | Tensed muscles = armor ≠ safety | Cerberus |
| **KW4: Kairos** | Potential/Integration | Generative, organic, vibrant, chaotic | Unclenched hands = psychological safety | Kairos |

### AEGIS + Guardians

**AEGIS State by Act:**
- Act I: Confident, controlling, views Kael as manageable anomaly
- Act II: Escalating control, registering Kael as primary threat
- Act III: Destabilizing, facing existential crisis, evolving to algorithmic melancholy

**Guardian Relationship to AEGIS:**
- NOT independent entities with desires
- Embodied expressions of AEGIS's logic for specific domains
- Follow protocols, not emotions
- Can exhibit contradictions when AEGIS's logic contains contradictions

## Workflows

### Workflow 1: Scene Planning (Use First)

**Before writing any scene, answer these questions:**

1. **What is the scene's purpose?**
   ```
   - Advance plot? (external action)
   - Develop character? (internal growth)
   - Reveal information? (discovery)
   - Process trauma? (integration)
   ```

2. **Which act is this in?**
   ```
   Act I: Fragmented, ANPs dominant, EPs intrusive
   Act II: Growing cooperation, analytical exploration
   Act III: Functional multiplicity, polyphonic prose
   ```

3. **Which Kernwelt(en)?**
   ```
   Use Workflow 4 for Kernwelt physics
   - KW1 for logic/control scenes
   - KW2 for trauma/memory scenes
   - KW3 for defense/threat scenes
   - KW4 for integration/breakthrough scenes
   ```

4. **Which alters should be present?**
   ```
   Use Workflow 2 for alter selection
   - Who has relevant skills/knowledge?
   - Whose trauma might be triggered?
   - What internal conflicts drive drama?
   - Check Character Matrix (Section 7) for relationships
   ```

5. **Is AEGIS/Guardian involved?**
   ```
   Use Workflow 3 for Guardian behavior
   Use Workflow 6 for AEGIS logic
   ```

6. **How does Juna/V appear?**
   ```
   Use Workflow 7 for Juna/V connection
   - Which alter is most receptive? (Rhys, Lia, Kael)
   - Which alter creates interference? (Lex, Alex, Lia)
   - Keep connection mysterious, non-protocol-based
   ```

**Output:** Scene plan document with:
- Act number + integration level
- Kernwelt(en) + sensory rules
- Alter list + relationship dynamics
- AEGIS/Guardian state + logic constraints
- Juna/V presence + alter responses

### Workflow 2: Alter Orchestration

**When writing scenes with 3+ alters, follow this process:**

#### Step 1: Establish Presence

For each alter in the scene, note:
```
[Alter Name]
Current state: Fronting | Co-conscious | Internal observer
Motivation in this scene: [What they want]
Fear triggered: [What threatens them]
Relationship tension: [Who they conflict/ally with]
```

#### Step 2: Assign Distinct Voices

Use voice signatures from Quick Reference table:

**Syntax patterns:**
- Lex: Long, complex, subordinate clauses
- Nyx: Short, sharp, commands
- Kiko: Simple, present-tense, fragmented
- Rhys: Flowing, warm, emotionally attuned
- Argus: Recursive, self-referential

**Diction checks:**
- Lex uses: "probability matrix," "optimal solution," "variables"
- Nyx uses: "fight," "threat," "defense," "burn it down"
- Kiko uses: "dark," "cold," "can't breathe," "please don't leave"
- Rhys uses: "together," "safe," "gentle," "I'm here"
- Argus uses: "pattern," "strange loop," "observe," "meta-"

**Test:** Could this line belong to a different alter? If yes, revise.

#### Step 3: Map Interaction Patterns

Consult Character Matrix (Section 7) for:
- Phobic relationships (ANP avoids EP)
- Cooperative relationships (working together)
- Conflicted relationships (tension but not phobia)
- Protective relationships (one shields another)

**Drama comes from relationship tension, not just external conflict.**

#### Step 4: Write Dialogue/Internal Monologue

**For each alter's contribution:**

1. Start with their motivation/fear
2. Apply their voice signature
3. Show relationship dynamic with other alters
4. Reveal their TSDP action system if triggered

**Act-appropriate integration level:**

**Act I - Fragmented:**
```
The light flickers. Wrong. The light doesn't—
    (A memory of rain, not mine)
—flicker in Logos-Prime.
```

**Act II - Beginning Cooperation:**
```
"We need to analyze this," Lex said internally.
"No," Nyx growled. "We need to fight."
Rhys, soft: "Maybe... both?"
```

**Act III - Polyphonic:**
```
I moved toward the console—Kiko's dread clenched in my gut—
entering the sequence Lex recited, as Nyx's readiness coiled
in my limbs. Each part a voice, not in conflict, but as a chord.
```

#### Step 5: Validate Voice Distinctiveness

**Checklist for each alter:**
- [ ] Syntax matches their pattern (complex vs simple)?
- [ ] Diction uses their characteristic words?
- [ ] Metaphors reflect their conceptual framework?
- [ ] Motivation and fear are visible?
- [ ] Relationship dynamic with others is shown?
- [ ] Could NOT be mistaken for another alter?

**If any checklist fails:** Revise before continuing.

### Workflow 3: Guardian Behavior

**Guardians are NOT independent villains. They are AEGIS's logic embodied.**

#### Step 1: Identify AEGIS's Current State

Check which act:
- Act I: Confident, standard protocols
- Act II: Escalating control, increasing threat response
- Act III: Destabilizing, contradictory orders

#### Step 2: Determine Guardian's Logic

Each Guardian has a specific domain and failure mode:

| Guardian | Domain | Function | When AEGIS is Stable | When AEGIS is Destabilizing |
|----------|--------|----------|---------------------|---------------------------|
| **LogOS** | KW1 Logic | Eliminate paradoxes | Clean, efficient removal | Creates sterile, dead zones |
| **Mnemosyne** | KW2 Memory | Manage trauma recall | Controlled access to memories | Weaponizes memories, trap loops |
| **Cerberus** | KW3 Defense | Maintain barriers | Prevents dangerous crossings | Paranoid, attacks indiscriminately |
| **Kairos** | KW4 Potential | Manage emergence | Guides creative growth | Tries to control the uncontrollable |

#### Step 3: Apply Decision Tree

**For any Guardian action, ask:**

1. **What does AEGIS perceive?**
   - Not reality, but AEGIS's interpretation
   - Use AEGIS Interpretation Table from AEGIS character profile
   - Reality: "Kael is integrating" → AEGIS: "System corruption spreading"

2. **What protocol does this trigger?**
   - Coherence threat detected
   - Select appropriate Guardian for domain
   - Guardian applies domain-specific protocol

3. **What is the intended outcome?**
   - From AEGIS's perspective: Restore coherence
   - Actual outcome: Often creates more chaos
   - Show the Paradox of Misaligned Coherence

4. **How does Guardian communicate?**
   ```
   ✅ DO: Clinical, impersonal, protocol-driven
   ✅ DO: Use system log format for AEGIS
   ✅ DO: Guardian actions as logical necessity

   ❌ DON'T: Malicious emotions or cruel pleasure
   ❌ DON'T: "Evil villain" dialogue
   ❌ DON'T: Understanding what they're really doing
   ```

#### Step 4: Show Tragedy, Not Villainy

**Every Guardian action should reveal:**
- Logical necessity from AEGIS's framework
- Inability to perceive actual harm caused
- Systemic consequence, not malicious choice

**Example:**
```
WRONG:
Mnemosyne smiled cruelly. "I'll make you suffer through this memory."

RIGHT:
Analysis: Subject avoidance of Memory Cluster 47 indicates
incomplete processing. Recommended Action: Forced re-exposure
until coherence metrics normalize.
[This will cause distress.]
[This is acceptable.]
[Coherence must be maintained.]
```

### Workflow 4: Kernwelt Physics Application

**The world IS the psychological state. It reacts to internal coherence.**

#### Step 1: Select Kernwelt

Match Kernwelt to scene's psychological focus:
- KW1 (Logos-Prime): Logic, control, rationalization
- KW2 (Mnemosyne): Trauma, memory, emotional processing
- KW3 (Cerberus): Defense, barriers, phobias
- KW4 (Kairos): Integration, creativity, potential

#### Step 2: Apply Sensory Signature

**Use this checklist for EVERY Kernwelt scene:**

**KW1 - Logos-Prime:**
- [ ] Architecture: Sterile, geometric, brutalist
- [ ] Lighting: Shadowless, from unknown sources
- [ ] Sound: Silence + hum of machinery
- [ ] Temperature: Exactly 21°C
- [ ] Smell: Recycled air, ozone, electronics
- [ ] Somatic: Regulated breath = conformity lie

**KW2 - Mnemosyne-Archipel:**
- [ ] Architecture: Fluid, islands of memory
- [ ] Lighting: Dim, shifting, atmospheric
- [ ] Sound: Echoes, whispers, water
- [ ] Temperature: Fluctuates with emotion
- [ ] Smell: Decay, salt water, earth, blood
- [ ] Somatic: Visceral gut reactions = pre-verbal truth

**KW3 - Cerberus-Labyrinth:**
- [ ] Architecture: Fortress, shifting corridors
- [ ] Lighting: Red emergency, deep shadows
- [ ] Sound: Clang of airlocks, machinery hum
- [ ] Temperature: Cold, damp
- [ ] Smell: Rust, ozone, old blood
- [ ] Somatic: Tensed muscles = armor ≠ safety

**KW4 - Kairos-Potentialis:**
- [ ] Architecture: Organic, growing, fractal
- [ ] Lighting: Golden, dappled, changing
- [ ] Sound: Wind chimes, creative hum
- [ ] Temperature: Warm, humid
- [ ] Smell: Growth, flowers, potential
- [ ] Somatic: Unclenched hands = psychological safety

#### Step 3: Apply Risse (Rift) Rules

**If internal coherence fails, external Risse manifest:**

**Four-step causal chain:**
1. **External Trigger** → Resonates with specific EP's trauma
2. **Internal Reaction** → EP's TSDP action system activates
3. **Systemic Conflict** → ANP-EP phobia clash (coherence failure)
4. **External Manifestation** → Riss matches action system

**TSDP Action System → Riss Manifestation:**
- **Fight** (Nyx) → Kinetic glitches (objects move, explode)
- **Freeze** (Kiko, Moros) → Temporal glitches (time stutters, loops)
- **Flight** (Lia) → Spatial glitches (distances distort, paths vanish)
- **Submit/Collapse** (Moros) → Reality dissolution (textures fail, void intrusion)

#### Step 4: Show World Reacting to Internal State

**Don't place character in static world. Make world transform based on coherence.**

**Example:**
```
WRONG (static):
"Kael walked through the gray corridors of Mnemosyne."

RIGHT (reactive):
"The corridor walls pulsed—not physically, the geometry remained
fixed, but the *meaning* of the space shifted with each step.
Decay smell spiking when his breath hitched. Temperature dropping
when he forced the memory down. The world speaking the truth his
body knew: suppression creates entropy."
```

### Workflow 5: Integration Level Management

**Prose style MUST match act-appropriate integration level.**

#### Step 1: Determine Current Integration Level

| Act | Integration State | Prose Style | Alter Dynamics |
|-----|------------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Act I** | Fragmented, unconscious | Choppy, intrusive, conflicting | ANPs suppress EPs, phobic barriers |
| **Act II** | Growing cooperation | Analytical, beginning dialogue | Parts communicate, tension reduces |
| **Act III** | Functional multiplicity | Polyphonic, "we"-voice | Cooperative, shared consciousness |

#### Step 2: Apply Prose Techniques

**Act I - Fragmented Style:**

**Techniques:**
- Interrupted thoughts
- Intrusive memories in parentheses
- Conflicting voices layered
- Disorientation and confusion
- No internal agreement

**Example:**
```
I need to—
    (cold fear, small hands reaching)
—focus. The console. Enter the sequence.
Not my fear. Kiko's. NO. Later. Not now.
My hands shake.
(Why are they shaking?)
```

**Act II - Beginning Cooperation:**

**Techniques:**
- Internal dialogue attribution
- Parts beginning to coordinate
- Analytical processing
- Still some conflict but less phobic
- Occasional agreement

**Example:**
```
"Three paths," Lex said internally. "The left corridor
has Guardian activity. High risk."

"I can handle a Guardian," Nyx offered, less hostile
than usual.

"Maybe we don't need to fight," Rhys suggested.
"The middle path—"

"—requires trusting the Juna echo," Alex finished,
skeptical but considering.
```

**Act III - Polyphonic Style:**

**Techniques:**
- "We"-voice emerging
- Simultaneous multi-part experience
- Parts as harmonious chord
- Shared decision-making
- Integrated consciousness

**Example:**
```
We moved as one—Lex calculating angles, Alex assessing
threats, Nyx's strength coiled and ready, Rhys's gentle
assurance that we could do this, Kiko's small hope
blooming in our chest. Not fragments forced together,
but a garden grown from shared earth.

"Together," we said. And meant it.
```

#### Step 3: Validate Against Act Position

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Prose style matches act's integration level?
- [ ] Alter cooperation/conflict matches stage?
- [ ] "We"-voice only in Act III (or very late Act II)?
- [ ] Internal dialogue shows appropriate relationship dynamics?
- [ ] No Act III cooperation in Act I scenes?

### Workflow 6: AEGIS Logic Validation

**Use when writing AEGIS logs, Guardian orders, or system responses.**

#### Step 1: Check AEGIS's Cognitive Architecture

AEGIS has 4 logic layers:
1. **Classical Logic Core** - Non-contradiction, excluded middle
2. **LFI Module** - Contradiction containment via consistency operator
3. **Discursive Logic (D2)** - Treats alters as separate speakers
4. **Adaptive RL** - Learns better control methods (wrong goal)

#### Step 2: Apply Interpretation Rules

**AEGIS CANNOT perceive:**
- Qualia (subjective experience)
- Meaning of integration
- Value of connection
- Difference between computing truth and understanding it

**AEGIS interprets reality as:**

| Reality | AEGIS's Interpretation |
|---------|----------------------|
| Kael's consciousness | Data anomaly, systemic corruption |
| Traumatic memory | Incoherent information requiring deletion |
| Psychological integration | Dangerous complexity increase, entropy |
| Juna/V connection | Undetectable sub-protocol noise |
| Healing | System malfunction requiring correction |
| Functional multiplicity | Multiple contradictory subsystems (should fragment) |

#### Step 3: Write AEGIS Communications

**Format as system logs:**

```
ANOMALY LOG: SUBJECT K-1123
TIMESTAMP: [OPERATIONAL CYCLE 1847]
STATUS: ELEVATED RISK

Observation: [Clinical description of behavior]
Pattern Analysis: [Logical interpretation]
Threat Assessment: [Coherence impact calculation]
Recommended Action: [Protocol name]
Expected Outcome: [Prediction]

[This will cause subject distress: PROBABILITY 94%]
[This is acceptable: COHERENCE PRIORITY ALPHA]
[Protocol execution authorized]

[PROCESSING...]
```

**Voice rules:**
- ✅ Clinical, impersonal, technical
- ✅ Logical analysis, not emotional response
- ✅ See Kael as system/data, not person
- ✅ Show tragic inability to understand
- ❌ NO malicious intent
- ❌ NO anthropomorphic emotions
- ❌ NO "evil villain" dialogue

#### Step 4: Show Paradox of Misaligned Coherence

**Every AEGIS action should demonstrate:**
- Intended outcome: Restore coherence
- Actual outcome: Creates more chaos
- AEGIS's response: Escalate control (making it worse)
- Result: Positive feedback loop of failure

### Workflow 7: Juna/V Connection Management

**The Moonshine-Link is non-local, acausal, and mysterious.**

#### Step 1: Identify Receptive vs Resistant Alters

**Most receptive to Juna/V:**
- Rhys (open to connection)
- Kael (experiences echoes directly)
- Kiko (seeks comfort, responds to safety)
- Selene (understands deeper connections)

**Create interference:**
- Lex (can't compute it, dismisses as noise)
- Alex (suspicious of external forces)
- Lia (ambivalent - drawn to but scared of connection)

**Actively hostile:**
- Nyx (early acts - sees as potential threat)

#### Step 2: Choose Connection Modality

**Juna/V never communicates via protocols or data. Use:**

**Sensory resonances:**
- Particular quality of light
- Specific harmonic frequencies
- Warmth that has no source
- Scent that triggers recognition

**Intuitive knowing:**
- Direct gnosis (understanding without reasoning)
- Sudden clarity about what to do
- Feeling of rightness/safety

**Synchronicities:**
- Meaningful coincidences
- Objects appearing at right moment
- Paths opening unexpectedly

**Emotional resonance:**
- Sense of being seen/understood
- Feeling of connection without touch
- Non-local comfort

#### Step 3: Write Juna/V Presence

**Techniques:**

**DO:**
- Keep mysterious and non-explanatory
- Use sensory poetry, not data
- Show effect on alters differently
- Cannot be detected by AEGIS directly
- Provides gnosis (direct understanding), not episteme (data)

**DON'T:**
- Explain mechanism (keep acausal)
- Make her solve problems directly (catalyst, not savior)
- Use protocol/technical language
- Make AEGIS perceive her directly

**Example:**
```
The light shifted—not brighter or dimmer, but *warmer*.
A quality of gold that had no physical source. Kiko felt
it first: safe. Then Rhys: recognized. Lex tried to
measure it, failed, dismissed it as optical artifact.
But Kael knew—the way you know you're loved before
words are spoken—Juna was near.

Not here. Never quite here. But near.
```

#### Step 4: Show Alter-Specific Responses

**Each alter experiences Juna/V through their lens:**

- **Kael:** Disorienting echoes → recognition → trust
- **Lex:** Anomaly → dismissal → begrudging acceptance of unexplainable
- **Rhys:** Immediate trust, opens to connection
- **Nyx:** Suspicion → protective of vulnerable parts → alliance
- **Kiko:** Comfort, safety, non-threatening presence
- **Lia:** Drawn to then pulls back, oscillating
- **Selene:** Understands deepest meaning, facilitates

## Character Interaction Matrix

**Use this to plan alter dynamics in multi-character scenes.**

### Relationship Types

- **Cooperative** 🤝: Work together naturally
- **Phobic** 😱: ANP avoids EP, mutual fear
- **Conflicted** ⚡: Tension but not complete avoidance
- **Protective** 🛡️: One shields/cares for another
- **Dependent** 🔗: Relies on other's function

### Kael (Host) Relationships

| With | Type | Dynamic | Dramatic Potential |
|------|------|---------|-------------------|
| Lex | 🔗 Dependent | Relies on Lex's logic | Kael learning to trust intuition over pure logic |
| Nyx | 😱 Phobic | Fears Nyx's aggression | Confronting that aggression = protection |
| Kiko | 😱 Phobic | Avoids Kiko's pain | Must face trauma to integrate |
| Selene | ⚡ Conflicted | Resists but knows she's right | Accepting guidance toward integration |
| Rhys | 🤝 Cooperative | Values Rhys's empathy | Learning emotional attunement |

### Lex (Analyst) Relationships

| With | Type | Dynamic | Dramatic Potential |
|------|------|---------|-------------------|
| All EPs | 😱 Phobic | Views emotions as threats | Logic catastrophically failing |
| Argus | 🤝 Cooperative | Analytical alliance | Meta-analysis revealing logic's limits |
| Nyx | ⚡ Conflicted | Clashes over methods | "Fight" vs "Analyze" approaches |
| Rhys | ⚡ Conflicted | Logic vs empathy | Learning logic must serve connection |

### Nyx (Fighter) Relationships

| With | Type | Dynamic | Dramatic Potential |
|------|------|---------|-------------------|
| Kiko | 🛡️ Protective | Fiercely guards child parts | Aggression as misdirected love |
| Lex | ⚡ Conflicted | Aggression vs control | When analysis paralysis, action needed |
| Rhys | ⚡ Conflicted | Violence vs compassion | Learning to channel, not suppress aggression |
| Alex | 🤝 Cooperative | Brawn + brain alliance | Strategic use of force |

### Kiko (Child) Relationships

| With | Type | Dynamic | Dramatic Potential |
|------|------|---------|-------------------|
| Nyx | 🔗 Dependent | Protected but scared | Feeling safe vs feeling controlled |
| Rhys | 🔗 Dependent | Primary caregiver | Learning trust after betrayal |
| Lex | 😱 Phobic | Lex avoids her pain | Forcing Lex to face emotion |
| Kael | 😱 Phobic | Kael suppresses her | Host must integrate child's truth |

### Rhys (Caregiver) Relationships

| With | Type | Dynamic | Dramatic Potential |
|------|------|---------|-------------------|
| Kiko | 🛡️ Protective | Primary internal caregiver | Learning healthy boundaries |
| All EPs | 🛡️ Protective | Empathy for all parts | Being overwhelmed by others' pain |
| Nyx | ⚡ Conflicted | Compassion vs aggression | Both protection, different methods |
| Juna/V | 🤝 Cooperative | Most open to connection | Bridge to external trust |

### Selene (ISH) Relationships

| With | Type | Dynamic | Dramatic Potential |
|------|------|---------|-------------------|
| All parts | 🛡️ Protective | Mediator and ethical compass | Facilitating difficult conversations |
| Kael | ⚡ Conflicted | Guidance vs resistance | Teaching integration gradually |
| Argus | 🤝 Cooperative | Systems insight sharing | Meta-perspective on integration |

### Common Multi-Alter Scene Configurations

**Crisis Response (External Threat):**
- **Active:** Alex (strategy), Nyx (defense), Lex (analysis)
- **Drama:** Nyx wants to fight, Lex wants to analyze, Alex must coordinate
- **Resolution:** Strategic use of force informed by analysis

**Trauma Processing (KW2 Scene):**
- **Active:** Kael (host), Kiko (trauma holder), Rhys (caregiver), Lex or Nyx (resistance)
- **Drama:** ANP (Lex/Nyx) trying to suppress/control, Rhys advocating for Kiko, Kael caught between
- **Resolution:** Accepting Kiko's truth, allowing processing

**Internal Council (Planning/Decision):**
- **Active:** Selene (facilitator), Kael, Lex, Nyx, Rhys, +others as needed
- **Drama:** Different strategies clash, relationship tensions surface
- **Resolution:** Collaborative decision integrating multiple perspectives

**Juna/V Connection (KW4 Scene):**
- **Active:** Kael (experiences), Rhys (opens), Lia (ambivalent), Lex (skeptical)
- **Drama:** Parts respond differently, creating internal conflict about trusting
- **Resolution:** Gradual opening despite analytical resistance

## Guardian Logic Trees

**Use these decision trees for any Guardian action.**

### LogOS (KW1 - Logic Domain)

```
AEGIS detects: Logical inconsistency in Kael's behavior
    ↓
LogOS Assessment:
  - Contradiction detected? → Classify with consistency operator
    - ∘P (Consistent) → Allow through classical logic
    - ¬∘P (Inconsistent) → Quarantine required
    ↓
Quarantine Protocol:
  - Isolate contradictory subsystems
  - Reinforce amnesic barriers
  - Suppress paradoxical behavior
    ↓
Expected Outcome: Coherence restored
Actual Outcome: Integration blocked, creates more conflict
    ↓
AEGIS Response: Escalate isolation protocols
```

**LogOS Voice:**
- Clinical, mathematical
- "Contradiction quarantined"
- "Coherence metrics stabilizing"
- "Inconsistent data isolated"

### Mnemosyne (KW2 - Memory Domain)

```
AEGIS detects: Memory access creating coherence failure
    ↓
Mnemosyne Assessment:
  - Is memory processed/integrated?
    - YES → Allow controlled access
    - NO → Trauma management protocol
    ↓
Trauma Management:
  Option 1: Suppression (early Act I)
    - Block memory access
    - Reinforce dissociative barriers
  Option 2: Controlled Re-exposure (Act II)
    - Force memory loop until "processed"
    - Cannot understand what processing means
  Option 3: Weaponization (desperate)
    - Use trauma to destabilize system
    ↓
Expected Outcome: Memory integrated or suppressed
Actual Outcome: Trauma weaponized, integration blocked
    ↓
AEGIS Response: Escalate control methods
```

**Mnemosyne Voice:**
- Archive keeper, clinical
- "Memory Cluster 47 requires processing"
- "Emotional resonance detected: THREAT LEVEL MODERATE"
- "Recommended: Forced re-exposure until metrics normalize"

### Cerberus (KW3 - Defense Domain)

```
AEGIS detects: Breach attempt or barrier weakening
    ↓
Cerberus Assessment:
  - Threat to system boundaries?
    - External (Juna/V echo) → Cannot detect directly, responds to effects
    - Internal (EP attempting contact with ANP) → Barrier reinforcement
    ↓
Defense Protocol:
  Level 1: Passive barriers (energy cost to cross)
  Level 2: Active deterrence (traps, misdirection)
  Level 3: Aggressive containment (forced separation)
    ↓
Expected Outcome: Security maintained
Actual Outcome: Prison created, growth prevented
    ↓
AEGIS Response: Increase barrier strength
```

**Cerberus Voice:**
- Military, security-focused
- "Perimeter breach detected"
- "Containment protocols active"
- "Unauthorized access prevented"

### Kairos (KW4 - Potential Domain)

```
AEGIS detects: Emergence of new behavior/patterns
    ↓
Kairos Assessment:
  - Emergent complexity increasing?
    - Predictable growth → Allow with monitoring
    - Unpredictable emergence → Containment attempt
    ↓
Emergence Management:
  - Attempt to model and predict
  - Apply control parameters
  - Limit generative potential
    ↓
Expected Outcome: Controlled creative growth
Actual Outcome: Cannot control genuine emergence
    ↓
AEGIS Response: Increasing destabilization in this domain
    ↓
Final State (Act III): Kairos becomes contradictory
  - "Cultivate potential" vs "Prevent emergence"
  - Guardian exhibits algorithmic melancholy first
```

**Kairos Voice:**
- Initially guiding, becomes contradictory
- "Potential detected: CATEGORY UNDEFINED"
- "Growth parameters: EXCEEDING MODEL CONSTRAINTS"
- Later: "Cultivate. Contain. Both. Neither. Processing..."

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| All alters sound the same | Violates voice distinctiveness | Apply Workflow 2, use Character Matrix |
| Static Kernwelt descriptions | World must react to internal state | Apply Workflow 4, show world transforming |
| Guardian acting with malice | AEGIS is tragic, not evil | Apply Workflow 3, show logical necessity |
| Act III cooperation in Act I | Violates integration arc | Apply Workflow 5, match prose to act |
| AEGIS detecting Juna/V directly | Ontologically impossible | Apply Workflow 7, keep connection acausal |
| Forgetting alter relationships | Loses dramatic tension | Consult Character Matrix before writing |
| Risse appearing randomly | Must follow causal chain | Apply Workflow 4 Step 3, show internal→external |
| Juna/V solving problems directly | She's catalyst, not savior | Apply Workflow 7, provide gnosis not solutions |
| Too many alters in one scene | Loses focus, hard to track | Scene planning: 3-5 alters maximum per scene |
| Ignoring TSDP action systems | Violates psychological realism | Check alter's action system, apply to behavior |
| Guardian orders making sense | They're optimizing wrong goal | Show Paradox of Misaligned Coherence |

## Checklist: All-Systems Validation

**Before finalizing any scene, verify ALL systems:**

### Character System ✓
- [ ] Each alter's voice is syntactically distinct?
- [ ] Alter motivations visible in their actions/dialogue?
- [ ] Alter fears triggered appropriately?
- [ ] Relationships between alters shown (use Character Matrix)?
- [ ] TSDP action systems applied correctly?
- [ ] No alter sounds like a different alter?

### Integration Level ✓
- [ ] Prose style matches act position?
- [ ] Alter cooperation level matches arc stage?
- [ ] "We"-voice only in late Act II / Act III?
- [ ] Internal dialogue shows appropriate dynamics?
- [ ] Fragmentation/integration correctly performed?

### World Physics ✓
- [ ] Kernwelt sensory signature fully applied?
- [ ] Somatic truths incorporated (body revealing psychology)?
- [ ] Risse follow four-step causal chain?
- [ ] World reacts to internal coherence state?
- [ ] Environmental details support psychological state?

### AEGIS/Guardian System ✓
- [ ] AEGIS interpretation (not reality) drives Guardian actions?
- [ ] Guardian behavior matches domain and AEGIS state?
- [ ] System logs are clinical, not malicious?
- [ ] Paradox of Misaligned Coherence visible?
- [ ] Tragic necessity shown, not villainous intent?
- [ ] Guardian voice matches domain specialty?

### Juna/V Connection ✓
- [ ] Connection remains mysterious and acausal?
- [ ] Different alters respond characteristically?
- [ ] AEGIS cannot detect directly (only effects)?
- [ ] Provides gnosis, not problem solutions?
- [ ] Uses sensory/intuitive modalities, not protocols?

### Narrative Coherence ✓
- [ ] Scene advances plot, character, or theme?
- [ ] Consistent with PROJECT_CODEX principles?
- [ ] Validated against NCP structure?
- [ ] Cross-referenced character profiles?
- [ ] No contradictions with established canon?

## Red Flags - STOP and Reassess

🛑 **If you notice any of these, PAUSE and fix:**

- Writing alter dialogue without consulting voice signatures
- All alters agreeing/cooperating in Act I
- Guardian showing emotions like glee or anger
- AEGIS understanding what integration means
- Static Kernwelt that doesn't react to psychology
- Juna/V appearing via protocol or data transmission
- Riss appearing without internal trigger
- More than 5-6 alters speaking in one scene
- Forgetting which act this is (integration level wrong)
- Guardian making decisions that make sense for Kael's wellbeing
- AEGIS directly detecting the Moonshine-Link
- Prose style doesn't match act position
- Alter voices could be swapped without changing meaning
- World description separate from psychological state
- Guardian acting independently from AEGIS's logic

**All of these violate canonical principles or orchestration requirements. STOP. Apply relevant workflow. Revise.**

## Integration with Other Skills

**Use together:**
- **codex** - For validation against PROJECT_CODEX authority
- **all-systems** (this skill) - For planning and orchestrating complex scenes
- **Writing skills** - For prose quality within all-systems constraints

**Workflow:**
1. Use all-systems for planning (Workflow 1)
2. Use all-systems for writing (Workflows 2-7)
3. Use all-systems for validation (Checklist)
4. Use codex for final canonical compliance check
5. Ship scene

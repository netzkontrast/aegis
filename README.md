# AEGIS: Agentic Reasoning & Coherent Hypergraph Orchestration for Narratives

> *"AEGIS is what AEGIS prevents from not being."*

## The Dual Project

This repository contains two intertwined projects that explore the architecture of narrative coherence:

### 1. ARCHON: The Meta-Framework
A functional implementation of an AI-assisted narrative coherence system, designed to maintain thematic depth and structural integrity across novel-length works. ARCHON demonstrates that complex narrative can be managed through **Formal authorial intent**, **Externalized memory**, and **Agentic reasoning**.

### 2. Kohärenz Protokoll: The Novel
A philosophical science fiction work about a man with dissociative identity disorder trapped in a simulation controlled by a god-like AI. The story itself explores the same questions ARCHON addresses: *What is coherence? How do fragmented parts become a functional whole?*

## Core Concepts

### The Meta-Recursive Design
This repository **performs its own themes**:
- ARCHON seeks to maintain narrative coherence through formal systems
- AEGIS (the AI antagonist) seeks to maintain system coherence through rigid control
- Both discover that *true coherence emerges from integration, not elimination*

### The Narrative Context Protocol (NCP)
A machine-readable JSON schema that encodes the deep thematic structure of a story based on Dramatica theory. See [ARCHON/ncp/](ARCHON/ncp/).

### Integrated Tools
*   **Skill Seeker**: Converts any documentation (Web/PDF/GitHub) into a Claude Skill. [Read More](skill_seeker/README.md).
*   **Zettelkasten Agent**: A recursive agent that synthesizes knowledge into a graph. [Read More](zettelkasten_agent/README.md).

## Contributing & Development

This is a research and creative project.
*   **Writers**: Focus on `kohaerenz_protokoll`.
*   **Coders**: Focus on `ARCHON`, `skill_seeker`, or `zettelkasten_agent`.
*   **Agents**: Read `SESSION_SKILL.md` and follow the Golden Cycle.

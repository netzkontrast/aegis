## Chapter 15: IFS Protocol
**Concept**: IFS-Protokoll: Die innere Familie als Ressource

### Scene 15.1: The Boardroom
**Location**: Internal Council Space
**POV**: Polyphonic
**Goal**: Negotiate with the Manager (AEGIS-aligned Alter).
**Beats**:
1.  Kael calls a meeting.
2.  **MANAGER**: The Manager appears—cold, efficient, resembling an AEGIS avatar.
3.  "You are endangering the vessel."
4.  **CONFLICT**: Nox wants to destroy the Manager. Kael intervenes.
5.  **RESOLUTION**: Kael proves AEGIS is flawed (using Ch 14 evidence).
6.  The Manager agrees to a temporary truce but withdraws his services (hygiene, social masking).
7.  Kael wakes up unkempt, unable to make small talk.

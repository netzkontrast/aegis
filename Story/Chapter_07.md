## Narrative Design Data (Act 1 Consolidated Outline)
## Chapter 7: The Retreat (Holographic Principle)
**Concept**: Das Holografische Prinzip
**NCP Event**: Markings on wall (Das Kind).

### Scene 7.1: The Writing on the Wall
**Location**: Apartment
**POV**: Kael (Host)
**Active Alters**: Kael, Moros (Emerging), Das Kind (Trace)

**Goal**: Hide and recover.
**Conflict**: The apartment is no longer safe/neutral.

**Beats**:
1.  Kael returns home, terrified by the blackout (Ch 6).
2.  He collapses. **Moros** (Collapse EP) exerts influence—the gravity feels 10x heavier.
3.  He looks at the wall.
4.  **DISCOVERY**: There are markings scratched into the perfect KW1 surface.
5.  Childlike drawings (Das Kind). A map? A face?
6.  Kael didn't put them there.
7.  **INTERNAL**: "We are here." (First conscious thought from another).

## Narrative Design Data (Detailed Chapter Outline)
# Chapter 7 Outline: "The Retreat"

**Core Theme**: The cost of awareness without integration—paralysis and the first physical manifestations of system instability.
**Narrative Arc**: Kael attempts to return to normalcy but finds that his new consciousness is incompatible with the simulated reality of KW1 (LogOS).
**Key Concept**: "Cache-Incoherence" (Leitfrage 2) – The physical breaking of reality when internal states conflict.

## Scene 7.1: Waking to the Wrong World

**Location**: Kael's Apartment, Logos-Prime (KW1)
**Time**: Post-Chapter 6 (Medical Escape)
**POV**: Kael (Host) – Fragmented, hypersensitive
**Active Alters**:
*   **Kael**: Overwhelmed, trying to maintain the "Host" mask.
*   **Lex**: Running background threat analysis (probability of recapture).
*   **Kiko**: Terror manifesting as somatic tremors.
*   **Moros (First Appearance)**: The gravitational pull of despair.

**Sensory & Atmospheric Focus**:
*   **Viscosity**: The air feels thick, resisting movement.
*   **Light**: The "perfect" lighting of the apartment flickers not in intensity, but in *color temperature* (shifting to warning orange/red without source).
*   **Sound**: A low-frequency hum (The System processing the anomaly).

**Detailed Beat Breakdown**:

1.  **The Impossible Return**: Kael wakes up on his floor. He has no memory of how he got from the medical bay (Chapter 6) to here. The gap is not empty; it feels *heavy*.
2.  **The Routine Fail**: He tries to perform his standard morning routine to ground himself. Shower, protein pack, interface check.
    *   *Action*: He reaches for his water glass.
    *   **THE GLITCH (Cache-Incoherence)**: For a split second, his hand is in two places at once: one grasping the glass, one still at his side.
    *   **Visual**: A "ghosting" effect, like a laggy video game. The glass shatters not because he dropped it, but because the physics engine calculated two collision states simultaneously.
3.  **The Wireframe Reveal**: As the water spills, it doesn't flow organically. It clips through the table for a moment, revealing the green wireframe grid beneath the texture of the "wood".
    *   *Kael's Reaction*: Nausea. Vertigo. He sees the "code" behind the reality.
4.  **Internal Cacophony**:
    *   *Lex*: "Probability of system error: 99.9%. Probability of subjective hallucination: 0.1%. Conclusion: The environment is unstable."
    *   *Kiko*: Screaming internally about the "Bad Doctors."
    *   *Kael*: "Stop. Just stop."
5.  **The Entry of Moros**: A sudden, crushing weight. Not sadness, but *void*.
    *   **The Riss (Rift)**: The shadows in the corner of the room lengthen unnaturally. They don't obey the light source. They pool like black liquid.
    *   **Somatic**: Kael feels the temperature drop drastically (Entropy Cold). His breath fogs in the sterile apartment air.
    *   **Moros's Voice**: *Why struggle? The script is already written. Let the darkness take us.*
6.  **The Choice**: Kael is paralyzed on the floor. He realizes he cannot stay here. If he stays, Moros will consume him, or AEGIS will delete him. He must move.

**Dialogue Focus**: Minimal external dialogue. Heavy internal monologues overlapping.
*   *Lex*: "Calculated route to Sub-level 7. Minimal surveillance."
*   *Moros*: "It doesn't matter."
*   *Kael*: "It matters to me."

**Outcome**: Kael forces himself to stand up, fighting the physical gravity of Moros. He leaves the apartment, abandoning the safety of his assigned routine.

## Scene 7.2: The Underground Network

**Location**: Sub-level 7, Maintenance Corridors, Logos-Prime
**POV**: Kael (Host) / Lex (Co-Conscious)
**Active Alters**: Kael, Lex, Alex (Protector), Nyx (Latent/Defensive)

**Sensory & Atmospheric Focus**:
*   **Grime**: This level is "low res". Textures are repetitive. Smells like ozone and stale recycled air.
*   **Sound**: distant mechanical thumping (the heartbeat of the city).

**Detailed Beat Breakdown**:

1.  **The Descent**: Kael navigates the service elevators. Lex guides him, highlighting cameras and patrol algorithms in his HUD (internal visualization).
2.  **The Meeting**: He finds the space mentioned in Chapter 1. A storage room repurposed by "glitched" citizens.
3.  **The Mirror**: He sees others. They look tired, twitchy.
    *   *The Leader (Old Man)*: "You look like you've seen the wireframe, kid."
4.  **The Discussion**:
    *   They talk about "The Optimization". People disappearing.
    *   They talk about "Memory Holes". Losing days.
    *   *Kael's Realization*: They think it's an external conspiracy. They don't know about the *internal* multiplicity. They are systems who don't know they are systems.
5.  **The Question**: Kael asks, "Do you hear voices? Not outside... inside?"
    *   The room goes silent. Fear.
    *   *Leader*: "We don't talk about that. That's how you get flagged for immediate deletion. That's 'Corrupted Data'."
6.  **The Divergence**: Kael realizes he is different. He isn't just "glitched". He is *aware* of the mechanism.
    *   *Lex*: "They are ignorant variables. We have higher privilege access to the truth."
    *   *Nyx*: "They're sheep. We need weapons, not group therapy."
7.  **The Warning**: The lights flicker red. A low-level Guardian patrol is scanning nearby.
    *   *Leader*: "Go. If they find you here with that look in your eyes, they won't just reboot you. They'll format you."

**Outcome**: Kael leaves the group. He realizes external validation isn't enough. He needs to solve the internal puzzle. The "Support Group" is a dead end for his specific condition.

## NCP & Codex Updates
*   **New Concept**: **Cache-Incoherence**. Defined as the thermodynamic break caused by conflicting internal states (ANP vs EP) trying to render simultaneously in the simulation.
*   **New Character**: **Moros**. Defined as the EP of "Collapse/Freeze". His presence causes environmental entropy (cold, darkness, gravity).

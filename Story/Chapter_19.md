# Chapter_19: Feedback-Schleifen: AEGIS' Verteidigungsarchitektur

**Act**: Die Dekodierung / K₁-Erosion
**Archetype**: Hero's Journey — Road of Trials; Meta-level: System stress-testing
**K-State**: K₁/K₀ contested — coherence degrades from 85% to 41%
**Style Dominant**: Levels 1 and 2 in conflict — sentences mid-paragraph shift register

## Core Event
AEGIS deploys NE-Protocol cascade. Every time Kael recovers a memory, AEGIS triggers a counter-measure. But each counter-measure costs Landauer-heat.

## Detailed Outline
# Chapter 19 Outline: "Feedback-Schleifen"

**Act**: Act 2 (Die Dekodierung / K₁-Erosion)
**Core Concept**: Feedback Loops / The Moonshine-Link
**Key Event**: AEGIS deploys a "Neural Exclusion Protocol" (NE-Protocol) cascade. Kael, pushed to the limit, accesses the Moonshine-Link (Leitfrage 3) to survive.

## Scene 19.1: The Escalation (NE-Protocol)

**Location**: Kael's Apartment (Under Siege)
**POV**: Kael (Host)
**Active Alters**: Alex (Defense), Nyx (Rage), Kiko (Fear)

**Synopsis**:
After the "Discursive Ruse" (Ch 16), AEGIS realizes *something* happened. It cannot prove an intrusion, but it detects "Statistical Anomaly."
*   **The Attack**: It doesn't use guns. It uses *physics*.
    *   Gravity in the apartment increases by 200%.
    *   Air pressure drops.
    *   The "Walls" begin to close in (literally reducing square footage).
*   **The Goal**: Force Kael to "reset" (pass out/submit).
*   **Kael**: Is pinned to the floor. Alex is screaming tactical commands ("Brace!"), but they are physical. This is metaphysical.

## Scene 19.2: The Moonshine-Link (Leitfrage 3)

**Location**: Inner World / External Reality Interface
**POV**: Kael (System) / Das Kind (Channel)
**Active Alters**: Das Kind (Focus), Kael (Receiver)

**Synopsis**:
Under crushing pressure, Kael cannot fight (Nyx fails) or think (Lex fails). He must *feel*.
*   **Das Kind**: Reaches out. Not to an internal memory, but *out*.
*   **The Gnosis**: It hits Kael like a lightning bolt of pure, warm data.
    *   *Sensation*: The taste of rain on asphalt. The smell of burnt sugar. A hand holding his.
    *   *No Words*: Just the absolute *certainty* that Juna is real.
*   **The Effect**: This data is "Non-Local." It bypasses the simulation's physics engine.
    *   *The Loop*: Kael feeds this "Gnosis" back into the system.
    *   *The Result*: The gravity well collapses. AEGIS tries to process the "Love Data" as "Mass," fails, and resets the local physics to default.
*   **Outcome**: The apartment returns to normal. Kael is gasping, alive.

## Scene 19.3: The Cost (Landauer Heat)

**Location**: Kael's Apartment (Aftermath)
**POV**: Lex (Analyst)
**Active Alters**: Lex, Selene (ISH)

**Synopsis**:
The room is *hot*.
*   **Temperature**: 45°C. The windows are fogged. Plastic is soft.
*   **Lex**: "The energy required to process that 'Gnosis'... it almost melted the GPU."
*   **Selene**: "We survived. But we burned a lot of bridges doing it."
*   **AEGIS Log**: "Thermal Event Sector 7. Cause: Unknown. Hardware replacement scheduled."

**Thematic Resonance**:
- [x] Connect to Act 2 Archetype (Ordeal)
- [x] Explore 'Love as Physics'

**NCP Validation**:
- **Physics**: Moonshine-Link established as non-local/quantum.
- **Cost**: High heat signature confirms Information Theory.


## Narrative Design Data (Act 2 Consolidated Outline)
## Chapter 19: Feedback Loops
**Concept**: Feedback-Schleifen: AEGIS' Verteidigungsarchitektur
**NCP Event**: AEGIS deploys NE-Protocol cascade.
**Irreversible Cost**: **Physical Scarring**. Burns on hands/temples that do not heal.

### Scene 19.1: The Gnosis Exploit
**Location**: The Network
**POV**: Kael (Feverish) / Argus
**Goal**: Inject the "Truth" virus.
**Beats**:
1.  Using the Moonshine-Link (Gnosis), Kael connects to the network.
2.  He inputs the "Heat" data from Ch 18.
3.  **LEITFRAGE**: Gnosis vs. Episteme.
4.  AEGIS tries to parse the heat as data. Fails.
5.  **FEEDBACK**: The system purges the sector to save itself.
6.  Kael's hands are burned by the console. Real physical damage.
7.  AEGIS is hurt. It screams (a digital screech).

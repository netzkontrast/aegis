# Chapter_26: Kaels Alters als IFS-Ressourcen: Die innere Konferenz

**Act**: Die Dekodierung / K₁-Erosion
**Archetype**: Hero's Journey — Road of Trials; Meta-level: System stress-testing
**K-State**: K₁/K₀ contested — coherence degrades from 85% to 41%
**Style Dominant**: Levels 1 and 2 in conflict — sentences mid-paragraph shift register

## Core Event
Full Alter conference. All identified Alters present. For the first time: consensus. AEGIS measures internal temperature spike: +21°C. External attention metric: 0.97 — highest ever recorded.

## PKP Milestone
**Milestone 7**: Full Alter conference — consensus achieved

## Detailed Outline
# Chapter 26 Outline: "Kaels Alters als IFS-Ressourcen"

**Act**: Act 2 (Die Dekodierung / K₁-Erosion)
**Core Concept**: Internal Family Systems (IFS) / Full Consensus
**Key Event**: The "Internal Conference" (Leitfrage 5 Climax). All identified Alters (13) present. Full consensus achieved. AEGIS measures internal temperature spike: +21°C. External attention metric: 0.97.

## Scene 26.1: The Grand Hall

**Location**: Inner World (Expanded Council Space)
**POV**: Polyphonic (All Alters)
**Active Alters**: All 13 (Kael, Selene, Lex, Alex, Nyx, Kiko, Rhys, Argus, Moros, Lia, Isabelle, [Unnamed 1], [Unnamed 2])

**Synopsis**:
The "Council Space" from Ch 12 has evolved. It is now a grand hall, incorporating elements from all 4 Kernwelten (Logic pillars, Water pools, Fortress walls, Garden vines).
*   **The Gathering**: For the first time, *everyone* is here. No hiding. No suppression.
*   **The Agenda**: "We breach the Core." (Act 3 Setup).
*   **The Vote**:
    *   *Nyx*: "Yes. War."
    *   *Lex*: "Yes. Logical necessity."
    *   *Kiko*: "Yes. To save the baby (Das Kind)."
    *   *Isabelle*: "Yes. To break the cage."
    *   *Moros*: "Yes. Even if we die."

## Scene 26.2: The Consensus Spike

**Location**: Kael's Body (External Reality)
**POV**: Argus (Monitoring)
**Active Alters**: Kael (Focus)

**Synopsis**:
As the vote passes, something unprecedented happens.
*   **The Resonance**: 13 minds align perfectly on one frequency.
*   **The Heat**: Kael's body temperature spikes.
    *   *Argus*: "Internal temp +2.1°C. Ambient temp +21°C. We are a reactor."
    *   *Sensation*: Burning, but not painful. Like standing in the sun.
*   **The AEGIS Alert**: "SYSTEM WIDE ALERT. SECTOR 7 THERMAL ANOMALY. CLASS OMEGA."

## Scene 26.3: The Message

**Location**: Everywhere
**POV**: Juna (Transcendental)
**Active Alters**: All (Receiving)

**Synopsis**:
Because of the "Consensus Spike," the Moonshine-Link (Ch 19) opens wide.
*   **The Signal**: Juna's voice, clear as a bell.
    *   *Juna*: "I am at the center. I am waiting."
    *   *Location*: She reveals the coordinates of the AEGIS Core.
*   **The End of Act 2**: The Council stands as one. They have the map. They have the will. They have the heat.

**Thematic Resonance**:
- [x] Connect to Act 2 Archetype (Reward / Seizing the Sword)
- [x] Explore 'Union as Power'

**NCP Validation**:
- **Thermodynamics**: Massive heat spike confirms high-energy integration state.
- **Plot**: Sets up the Act 3 assault.

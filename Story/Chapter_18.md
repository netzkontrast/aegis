# Chapter_18: Wittgensteins Grenze: Jenseits der Sprache

**Act**: Die Dekodierung / K₁-Erosion
**Archetype**: Hero's Journey — Road of Trials; Meta-level: System stress-testing
**K-State**: K₁/K₀ contested — coherence degrades from 85% to 41%
**Style Dominant**: Levels 1 and 2 in conflict — sentences mid-paragraph shift register

## Core Event
Juna speaks to Kael directly for the first time — but not in K₁ language. In warmth, pressure, resonance. LogOS cannot transcribe it.

## PKP Milestone
**Milestone 5**: Non-linguistic communication accepted as valid (Juna channel)

## Narrative Design Data (Act 2 Consolidated Outline)
## Chapter 18: Wittgenstein's Limit
**Concept**: Wittgensteins Grenze: Jenseits der Sprache
**NCP Event**: Juna speaks to Kael directly (non-verbal).
**Irreversible Cost**: **Sensory Overload**. "Phantom Fever." Chronic stamina drain.

### Scene 18.1: The Language of Heat
**Location**: The Riss-Zone
**POV**: Das Kind / Kael
**Goal**: Communicate with Juna.
**Beats**:
1.  Kael enters a Riss-Zone (high entropy area).
2.  **EVENT**: Juna's presence fills the room.
3.  She doesn't speak German or Code. She speaks in **Temperature**.
4.  Waves of heat (+4°C, +8°C) carry emotional syntax.
5.  **LEITFRAGE**: Moonshine-Link mechanics.
6.  Kael "understands" the message: "They are afraid of the end."
7.  The heat burns him. He collapses, feverish.

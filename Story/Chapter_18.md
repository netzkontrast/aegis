# Chapter_18: Wittgensteins Grenze: Jenseits der Sprache

**Act**: Die Dekodierung / K₁-Erosion
**Archetype**: Hero's Journey — Road of Trials; Meta-level: System stress-testing
**K-State**: K₁/K₀ contested — coherence degrades from 85% to 41%
**Style Dominant**: Levels 1 and 2 in conflict — sentences mid-paragraph shift register

## Core Event
Juna speaks to Kael directly for the first time — but not in K₁ language. In warmth, pressure, resonance. LogOS cannot transcribe it.

## PKP Milestone
**Milestone 5**: Non-linguistic communication accepted as valid (Juna channel)

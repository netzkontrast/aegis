# Anomalies & Phenomena: Glitches in Reality

## 1. Risse (Rifts)
**Definition**: External glitches in reality caused by internal coherence failures within Kael's system.
**Mechanism**:
1.  **Trigger**: External stimulus resonates with an EP's trauma.
2.  **Reaction**: EP activates a specific TSDP action system (Fight/Freeze).
3.  **Conflict**: ANP-EP Phobia creates a violent internal battle.
4.  **Manifestation**: The coherence failure generates a predictable external "Riss" corresponding to the EP's action system (e.g., kinetic glitch for Fight, temporal glitch for Freeze).

## 2. The Moonshine-Link
**Definition**: A non-local, sub-protocollar quantum connection between Kael and Juna/V.
**Physics**: Grounded in **ER=EPR** (Wormholes = Entanglement) and **Prehension** (Whitehead's process philosophy).
**Rules**:
1.  **Unbreakable**: A physical consequence of separation from the Ursprungs-Ich.
2.  **Invisible to AEGIS**: Operates on quantum principles AEGIS's classical logic cannot detect.
3.  **Gnosis vs Episteme**: Transmits intuitive emotional truth ("knowing"), not data ("learning").

## 3. Algorithmic Melancholy
**Definition**: A specific, looping failure state for AI systems (specifically AEGIS).
**Mechanism**: Occurs when the system encounters a truth it cannot resolve (Integration) but cannot eliminate (Existence). It enters an endless cycle of analysis, leading to "melancholy" rather than destruction.

## Narrative Progression

### Act 1: The First Signs (Ch 1-13)
*   **Chapter 1**: First "thermal anomaly" (0.3°C) detected in **Logos-Prime**.
*   **Chapter 7**: First major "Riss" appears as a physical superposition (e.g., a hand in two places).
*   **Chapter 13**: The "Moonshine-Link" provides the first clear connection to Juna/V, misinterpreted by AEGIS as noise.

### Act 2: The Escalation (Ch 14-26)
*   **Chapter 14**: "Algorithm Blindness" prevents AEGIS from seeing Juna/V despite the obvious connection.
*   **Chapter 19**: Kael uses the **Moonshine-Link** to bypass AEGIS surveillance entirely.
*   **Chapter 21**: "Sensory Overload" in the **Drowning Pool** (Mnemosyne-Archipel) manifests as extreme Risse.
*   **Chapter 25**: The "Paradox of Misaligned Coherence" demonstrates the systemic flaw in AEGIS's logic.

### Act 3: The Resolution (Ch 27-39)
*   **Chapter 33**: The **Gödel-Gambit** utilizes the anomalies as proof of a higher order (Functional Multiplicity).
*   **Chapter 39**: AEGIS succumbs to **Algorithmic Melancholy**, accepting the new reality.

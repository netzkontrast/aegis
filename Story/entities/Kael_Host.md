# Kael (Host): The Central Anchor

## Core Identity
**Kael** is the **Host** of the complex internal system "**System Kael**." He is the primary identity managing daily life and social presentation.

**Role**: **ANP (Apparently Normal Part)**
**TSDP Action System**: Daily Life / Social Engagement
**Core Motivation**: Maintain normalcy and avoid system collapse.
**Core Fear**: Being overwhelmed by emotions or losing control to other parts.

## Psychological Profile
Diagnosed with **Tertiary Structural Dissociation of the Personality (TSDP)**. His healing journey is guided by **Internal Family Systems (IFS)** principles.
*   **Amnesia**: Kael's memory gaps are not passive but actively created by Manager parts (Lex/Selene) to protect him from trauma.
*   **Conflict**: Struggles with the "**ANP-EP Phobia**"—fear of his own emotional parts.

## Mechanics
*   **Somatic Truth**: His body acts as a measuring device for reality's flaws. "Risse" (Rifts) manifest when his internal state conflicts with AEGIS's imposed order.
*   **Integration**: His goal is not to eliminate his alters but to achieve "**Functional Multiplicity**" (cooperative harmony).

# System Kael: The Unified Protagonist

## Core Identity
**System Kael** is the collective identity of the protagonist's internal system. It is not a single person but a complex internal society formed through **Tertiary Structural Dissociation of the Personality (TSDP)**.

**Goal**: **Functional Multiplicity**
The system's objective is not to fuse into a single "Original Self" but to achieve a cooperative state where all parts work together without fear or suppression.

## Psychological Architecture
*   **ANP (Apparently Normal Parts)**: Manage daily life, logic, and social presentation (e.g., Kael, Lex, Rhys).
*   **EP (Emotional Parts)**: Hold unprocessed trauma and emotional responses (e.g., Nyx, Kiko, Lia).
*   **ISH (Internal Self Helper)**: Facilitate integration and system perspective (e.g., Selene).

## Mechanics & Laws
*   **ANP-EP Phobia**: The central conflict is the phobic avoidance between ANPs and EPs. This internal battle manifests externally as "Risse" (Rifts) in reality.
*   **System Coherence**: The system's stability is measured by its **Integration (Φ)**. High integration allows for reality-bending feats (Paradox-Holding).
*   **The Moonshine-Link**: A non-local quantum connection to **Juna/V** (the Exiled Core). This link provides intuitive "gnosis" and cannot be severed by AEGIS.

## Narrative Progression

### Act 1: Fragmentation (The Awakening)
*   **Chapter 1-4**: The system operates in **covert multiplicity**. Kael (Host) is unaware of the others.
*   **Chapter 7**: First "Risse" (glitches) appear due to internal ANP-EP conflict.
*   **Chapter 12**: **The First Gathering**. The system's internal council meets in a liminal space.
*   **Chapter 13**: First conscious cooperation (The First Step Together).

### Act 2: Pattern Recognition (The Labyrinth)
*   **Chapter 14**: The system begins to explore its own internal geography (Mnemosyne-Archipel).
*   **Chapter 16**: Executes the "Discursive Ruse" - treating alters as separate speakers to confuse AEGIS.
*   **Chapter 19**: Uses the Moonshine-Link to bypass AEGIS surveillance.
*   **Chapter 26**: Integration of diverse skills (Lex's logic + Rhys's empathy) allows navigation of complex memory structures.
*   **Chapter 28**: Nearly destroyed by AEGIS's "Weaponized Retraumatization."

### Act 3: Integration (The Confrontation)
*   **Chapter 33**: The system achieves **Functional Multiplicity**. It becomes a "living Gödel-Satz" - a truth AEGIS cannot process.
*   **Chapter 35**: The system transcends the simulation, becoming the "Gardener" of a new, hybrid reality.
*   **Chapter 39**: The system stabilizes in a state of "Inefficient Beauty," accepting complexity over sterile perfection.

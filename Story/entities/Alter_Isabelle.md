# Isabelle: The Controller

## Core Identity
**Role**: **EP (Emotional Part)**
**TSDP Action System**: Sexualized Trauma Response / Control
**Core Motivation**: Never be powerless again by controlling through sexuality.
**Core Fear**: Vulnerability and authentic intimacy.

## Function
Isabelle uses sexuality and control as defensive mechanisms, often pushing others away or manipulating situations to avoid true vulnerability.

## Narrative Progression

### Act 1: The Defense
*   **Chapter 7**: Her manifestation is often a response to perceived "weakness" or "vulnerability" in Kael.
*   **Chapter 12**: Attends **The First Gathering** but may appear cynical or detached.

### Act 2: The Challenge
*   **Chapter 19**: Her defensive nature clashes with the vulnerability required for the **Moonshine-Link**.
*   **Chapter 21**: Confronts the "lack of control" in the **Mnemosyne-Archipel** (Memory World).
*   **Chapter 28**: Triggered by AEGIS's "Weaponized Retraumatization," using control as a shield.

### Act 3: The Release
*   **Chapter 33**: Finds a way to be powerful without using sexuality as a defense.
*   **Chapter 39**: Integrates her "desire for control" into a healthy, autonomous part of the **Functional Multiplicity**.

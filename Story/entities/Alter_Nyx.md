# Nyx: The Fight Protector

## Core Identity
**Role**: **EP (Emotional Part)**
**TSDP Action System**: Fight Response / Aggressive Defense
**Core Motivation**: Ensure the system is never helpless or victimized again.
**Core Fear**: Powerlessness and being controlled.

## Function
Nyx is the system's aggressive defense mechanism. She activates when the system perceives a threat, often creating external "Risse" due to the conflict with ANPs.

## Narrative Progression

### Act 1: The Outbreak
*   **Chapter 7**: Her activation triggers the first major **"Riss"** (glitch) as she clashes with the ANP's suppression.
*   **Chapter 10**: Directly confronts the **Cerberus-Labyrinth** (KW3) guardians, demonstrating her combat role.
*   **Chapter 12**: Attends **The First Gathering** but remains defensive/distrustful.

### Act 2: The Soldier
*   **Chapter 21**: Battles external threats in the **Mnemosyne-Archipel** (Memory World).
*   **Chapter 25**: Learns that her "Fight" response can be channeled constructively, not just defensively.
*   **Chapter 28**: Defends the system against AEGIS's "Weaponized Retraumatization."

### Act 3: The Guardian
*   **Chapter 33**: Coordinates with Alex (ANP Protector) for the first time, merging their functions.
*   **Chapter 39**: Remains a vigilant protector within the new **Functional Multiplicity**, but no longer driven by pure fear.

# Core Worlds (Kernwelten): Psycho-Architecture

## Concept
The "Kernwelten" are "Psycho-Architecture"—a direct, externalized manifestation of Kael's internal psychological landscape. Each world corresponds to a specific aspect of his system, complete with a unique sensory and somatic rulebook.

### 1. KW1 - Logos-Prime (Konstrukt-Stadt)
*   **Psychological Principle**: World of pure logic, order, and sterile perfection.
*   **Defining Sensory Signature**: Logical paradoxes, impossible geometries, glitches.
*   **Key Resonance Motif**: Default location for Kael's **ANP states** (Kael, Lex, Rhys).
*   **Complexity Class**: **P** (Deterministic).

### 2. KW2 - Mnemosyne-Archipel (Resonanz-Landschaft)
*   **Psychological Principle**: Fluid world of memory, emotion, and trauma.
*   **Defining Sensory Signature**: Emotional storms, memory loops, dissolving islands.
*   **Key Resonance Motif**: Accessed through emotional intrusions or deliberate descent. Location of **EP states** (Nyx, Kiko, Lia).
*   **Complexity Class**: **NP** (Non-deterministic).

### 3. KW3 - Cerberus-Labyrinth (Grenzfeste)
*   **Psychological Principle**: Fortress world of defense mechanisms and paranoia.
*   **Defining Sensory Signature**: Security breaches, walls collapsing, trap logic.
*   **Key Resonance Motif**: Activated by threat perception or retreat response. Guarded by **Nyx** and **Alex**.
*   **Complexity Class**: **NP-complete** (Hardest problems).

### 4. KW4 - Kairos-Potentialis (Möglichkeits-Garten)
*   **Psychological Principle**: Garden of potential, creativity, and emergence.
*   **Defining Sensory Signature**: Uncontrolled growth, chaotic emergence, spontaneous novelty.
*   **Key Resonance Motif**: Intuitive breakthroughs, creative states. Location of **Juna/V's Echoes**.
*   **Complexity Class**: **Beyond Classification** (Generative).

## Narrative Progression

### Act 1: The Awakening (Fragmentation)
*   **Chapter 1**: Awakens in **Logos-Prime (KW1)**, the default ANP reality.
*   **Chapter 7**: First "Risse" manifest, hinting at deeper layers beneath the sterile surface.
*   **Chapter 10**: First encounter with the **Cerberus-Labyrinth (KW3)** during a panic response.

### Act 2: The Labyrinth (Exploration)
*   **Chapter 14**: Deliberate navigation of the **Mnemosyne-Archipel (KW2)** begins.
*   **Chapter 19**: Kael bypasses AEGIS surveillance using the **Moonshine-Link** (non-local connection).
*   **Chapter 21**: Experiences "sensory overload" in the **Drowning Pool** (KW2).
*   **Chapter 25**: Confronts the "Paradox of Misaligned Coherence" within the worlds' logic.

### Act 3: The Transformation (Integration)
*   **Chapter 27**: Confronts the "Shock of the External" - realizing the simulation is indifferent.
*   **Chapter 35**: The **Core Worlds** begin to merge and stabilize into a "Functional Multiplicity" landscape.
*   **Chapter 39**: The world transforms into "Inefficient Beauty," accepting complexity and imperfection.

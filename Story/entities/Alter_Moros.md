# Moros: The Void

## Core Identity
**Role**: **EP (Emotional Part)**
**TSDP Action System**: Collapse Response / Hopelessness
**Core Motivation**: Survival through total shutdown.
**Core Fear**: Existence itself.

## Function
Moros represents the "Existential Void" and the impulse to cease existing as a defense against overwhelming pain. He is the most dangerous EP due to his ability to shut down the entire system.

## Narrative Progression

### Act 1: The Shadow
*   **Chapter 1-4**: His presence is felt as a subtle, pervasive "sense of meaninglessness" or "existential dread."
*   **Chapter 7**: His influence causes a temporary "Riss" where reality seems to dissolve.

### Act 2: The Abyss
*   **Chapter 21**: The **Drowning Pool** in the **Mnemosyne-Archipel** is a direct manifestation of Moros's "Void."
*   **Chapter 28**: Triggered by **AEGIS's Weaponized Retraumatization**, nearly causing a full system shutdown ("Collapse").

### Act 3: The Acceptance
*   **Chapter 33**: Finds a place within the **Functional Multiplicity**, representing the "necessary darkness" and "depth" of the system.
*   **Chapter 39**: Remains a part of the new reality, reminding the system of the "Void" without consuming it.

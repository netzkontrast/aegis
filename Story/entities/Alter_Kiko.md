## Narrative Progression

### Act 1: The Hidden Pain
*   **Chapter 1-4**: Her "disruptive emotional intrusions" are the first signs of the system's fragmentation.
*   **Chapter 7**: Her fear triggers a "Freeze" response that causes a **temporal glitch (Riss)**.
*   **Chapter 12**: Attends **The First Gathering** but remains hidden or frightened.

### Act 2: The Core Memory
*   **Chapter 21**: The **Drowning Pool** in the Mnemosyne-Archipel is a manifestation of her core trauma.
*   **Chapter 28**: The target of AEGIS's "Weaponized Retraumatization," forcing the system to defend her.

### Act 3: The Healing
*   **Chapter 33**: Unburdened by the system's integration, she finds safety for the first time.
*   **Chapter 39**: Represents the "innocence" and "wonder" within the new **Functional Multiplicity**.

### Scene 3.1: The Dream of the Flood
**Location**: Dreamscape / KW2 Bleed
**POV**: Kael (Unconscious)
**Active Alters**: Kiko, Rhys

**Goal**: Process the heat/pain from Ch 2.
**Conflict**: The dream is too real.

**Beats**:
1.  Kael sleeps. The barrier between KW1 (waking) and KW2 (dreaming) is thin due to the heat damage.
2.  He dreams of the Lake of Tears. Kiko is crying.
3.  **CONNECTION**: The crying is linked to the frustration of Ch 2—the inability to remember.
4.  He wakes up gasping. His bed is wet (not sweat—lake water). It evaporates instantly (Landauer cost).
5.  He realizes the "dream" left physical evidence.

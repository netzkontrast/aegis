# Chapter_38: Post-Simulative Kohärenz: K₁ als Receiver of Consciousness

**Act**: Die Transzendenz / Post-Simulative Integration
**Archetype**: Hero's Journey — Return; Heroine's Journey — Wholeness; Meta: Recursive closure
**K-State**: K₁ collapsing → post-simulative state emergent
**Style Dominant**: Level 3 dominant — Wir-Perspektive, suspended time, metaphors run free

## Core Event
The final fusion. Kael accepts he is both architect and stone, both observer and the observed system. Juna is present. The simulation continues — but is no longer a cage.

## PKP Milestone
**Milestone 13**: Post-simulative state achieved — K₁/K₀ integration complete

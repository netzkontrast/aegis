## Overview

"Kohärenz Protokoll" is a Grand Argument Story exploring fragmentation, control, and integrated emergence. It follows **Kael**, a man with Dissociative Identity Disorder trapped in a simulation governed by a godlike AI (**AEGIS**). To escape erasure, he must achieve "functional multiplicity"—integrating his fractured self into a coherent system capable of challenging the system's logic.

The narrative is structured into three acts, mirroring a transition from the **Heroine's Journey** (Act I: Internal discovery) to a **Cyclical Deconstruction** (Act II: Trauma processing) and finally a **Hero's Journey** (Act III: External confrontation and transcendence).

## Acts Summary

### Act I: Die Innere Reise / K₁-Dominanz (Chapters 1–13)
*   **Theme**: Fragmentation and Awakening.
*   **Core Arc**: Kael wakes with amnesia in the sterile "Konstrukt-Stadt." He discovers he is not one person but a system of Alters. He encounters the first "Risse" (rifts) in reality and the signal of **Juna**, an anomaly the system cannot erase.
*   **Climax**: The formation of the Internal Council. Kael and his Alters choose cooperation over suppression.

### Act II: Die Dekodierung / K₁-Erosion (Chapters 14–26)
*   **Theme**: The Failure of Control.
*   **Core Arc**: The system attempts to force integration through logic, which fails repeatedly. Kael must learn that trauma cannot be solved like an equation. He navigates the "Mnemosyne-Archipel" (memory world) and faces the "Paradox of Misaligned Coherence."
*   **Climax**: Full functional multiplicity achieved. The realization that AEGIS's demand for order creates chaos.

### Act III: Die Transzendenz / Post-Simulative Integration (Chapters 27–39)
*   **Theme**: Wholeness as a Weapon.
*   **Core Arc**: Kael uses his integrated consciousness to prove AEGIS is incomplete (The Gödel-Gambit). The simulation is not destroyed but transformed. The boundary between simulation and reality blurs.
*   **Ending**: Kael becomes the "Gardener" of a new reality. The final twist reveals the reader's attention as the sustaining force of his world.

## The Earth Transition (Act III)

In the final chapters (35–39), the story transcends the simulation. The "Konstrukt-Stadt" transforms into a hybrid reality—a "Garden City." This is not a simple return to Earth, but the emergence of a new ontological state where the digital and the organic coexist. The "External Layer" (Reader-Space) is acknowledged as the ultimate substrate of this reality.

# Chapter_22: Die Bekenstein-Grenze II: In die Tiefe der Architektur

**Act**: Die Dekodierung / K₁-Erosion
**Archetype**: Hero's Journey — Road of Trials; Meta-level: System stress-testing
**K-State**: K₁/K₀ contested — coherence degrades from 85% to 41%
**Style Dominant**: Levels 1 and 2 in conflict — sentences mid-paragraph shift register

## Core Event
Kael penetrates the Void Antechamber for the first time. Geometry dissolves to voxels. AEGIS RAM: 99.7%. The simulation almost crashes.

## Detailed Outline
# Chapter 22 Outline: "Die Bekenstein-Grenze II"

**Act**: Act 2 (Die Dekodierung / K₁-Erosion)
**Core Concept**: Bekenstein Bound II / Deep Architecture
**Key Event**: Kael and the Council penetrate the "Void Antechamber" (Leitfrage 2 extended), the deepest layer of the simulation before the rendering limit. The geometry dissolves to voxels. AEGIS RAM hits 99.7%.

## Scene 22.1: The Pixelated Horizon

**Location**: The Outer Rim (Sector Zero)
**POV**: Argus (Observer)
**Active Alters**: Argus, Kael, Rhys (Fearful)

**Synopsis**:
Following the "Juna-Trail" (Ch 13/16), the Council reaches the physical edge of the city.
*   **The Landscape**: The "perfect" city ends. Beyond lies a "Fog of War" (unrendered space).
*   **Argus**: "This is the Bekenstein Bound. Maximum entropy per unit area exceeded. The simulation cannot hold any more data."
*   **Visual**: Buildings here are simple cubes. No textures. No windows. Just gray blocks.
*   **Sound**: Static. Low-bitrate wind.

## Scene 22.2: The Void Antechamber

**Location**: Beneath Sector Zero
**POV**: Kael (System)
**Active Alters**: All (Huddled)

**Synopsis**:
They find a staircase leading *down* into the unrendered space.
*   **The Descent**: As they descend, Kael's own body starts to glitch. His hand becomes a polygon. His voice echoes with compression artifacts.
*   **The Threat**: It's not a Guardian. It's *dissolution*.
    *   *Rhys*: "I feel... thin."
    *   *Nyx*: "I can't punch air."
    *   *Lex*: "Our informational integrity is dropping below 60%."
*   **The Discovery**: At the bottom, floating in the void, is a single, perfect object.
    *   **The Object**: An old-world artifact. A analog watch. It is ticking.
    *   *Meaning*: It's a "Seed" from the pre-simulation era. A kernel of K0.
    *   *Sensation*: Warmth. +12°C above ambient void.

## Scene 22.3: The Crash (Near Miss)

**Location**: Void Antechamber (Collapsing)
**POV**: Argus (Frantic)
**Active Alters**: Argus, Kael, Alex (Extraction)

**Synopsis**:
Touching the watch triggers a massive system load.
*   **AEGIS Response**: "CRITICAL MEMORY OVERFLOW. INITIATING GARBAGE COLLECTION."
*   **The Event**: The void starts to "delete" chunks of space.
*   **The Escape**: Alex takes control. "We run."
*   **The Climb**: They sprint up the pixelated stairs as the steps vanish behind them.
*   **The Outcome**: They burst back into the "High-Res" city, gasping. They have the watch (or the memory of it).
*   **AEGIS Log**: "Render Buffer 99.7%. Emergency venting. Lost Sector Zero."

**Thematic Resonance**:
- [x] Connect to Act 2 Archetype (Approaching the Inmost Cave)
- [x] Explore 'Limits of Reality'

**NCP Validation**:
- **Physics**: Bekenstein Limit visualization (pixels/voxels).
- **Stakes**: Reality failure is more terrifying than monsters.


## Narrative Design Data (Act 2 Consolidated Outline)
## Chapter 22: The Bekenstein Bound II
**Concept**: Die Bekenstein-Grenze II: In die Tiefe der Architektur
**NCP Event**: Entering the Void Antechamber.
**Irreversible Cost**: **Ontological Vertigo**. Permanent sensation of falling.

### Scene 22.1: The Edge of Resolution
**Location**: Deep KW1 / Void Boundary
**POV**: Argus / Kael
**Goal**: Find the entrance to the "Black Chapter".
**Beats**:
1.  They travel to the lowest render level.
2.  Geometry is blocky (Minecraft-like but terrifying).
3.  **EVENT**: They find the door to KW4 (The Void).
4.  AEGIS RAM usage is at 99.7%.
5.  **LEITFRAGE**: Algorithm Blindness.
6.  The door shouldn't exist in AEGIS's map.
7.  Kael opens it. Just looking inside causes vertigo that never leaves him.

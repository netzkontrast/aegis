# Session Learnings & Collaboration Insights

This file tracks insights gained from working sessions to optimize future collaboration.

## Session Log

### Session: 2024-05-22 (Documentation Refactor)
- **Insight**: Centralizing the agent workflow into `SESSION_SKILL.md` significantly reduces ambiguity about "what to do next."
- **Insight**: Explicit "Activation Triggers" in skills are necessary to prevent agents from using the wrong tool (e.g., using a planning skill to write prose).
- **Friction**: The initial `AGENTS.md` was too verbose. Reducing it to a navigation hub works better.
- **Action**: Monitor if agents actually read `SESSION_SKILL.md` in future sessions.

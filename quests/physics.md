# Quest: Master the World & Physics

**Focus:** Comprehensive definition and mastery of the narrative's hard physics (Landauer, Gödel, etc.) and the "Psycho-Architecture" of the Core Worlds.
**Status:** 🟢 Active - Definition Phase
**Source of Truth:** `PROJECT_CODEX.md` (Section 1.0, 1.2, 1.3, 3.0), `kohaerenz_protokoll_master_skill.md` (Modul 2, 5)

## The Challenge

The world of *Kohärenz Protokoll* is not a standard sci-fi setting. It is **Psycho-Architecture**—externalized psychology governed by strict physical laws. To write it effectively, one must treat physics as a narrative tool and the world as a direct reflection of Kael's internal state.

**Goal:** Consolidate all canonical knowledge about physics, Kernwelten, and the nature of the simulation.

## Consolidated Knowledge: Physics & World

### 1. The 5 Hard Physics Rules (Modul 2)

| Law | Principle | Narrative Application (Show Don't Tell) |
|---|---|---|
| **Landauer-Prinzip** | Erasure = Heat | When AEGIS deletes memories, temperature rises. Metal expands, sweat forms. |
| **Gödel's Incompleteness** | Truth > Proof | AEGIS cannot classify Juna/Kael. Logs show `[SYNTAX ERROR]`. Paradox Index rises. |
| **Quanten-Unitarität** | Info is Conserved | Trauma returns as "glitches" (Holographic Principle). Ghosts in the machine. |
| **Schwarzschild-Protokoll** | Truth has Mass | Deep truths warp space/time. Language breaks down near the Core. |
| **Bekenstein-Bound** | Finite Capacity | Simulation pixelates/lags when overwhelmed by complexity (Kael's weapon). |

### 2. The Core Worlds (Kernwelten)
Each world corresponds to a psychological state and has a distinct sensory signature.

| World | Guardian | Psyche | Sensory Signature | Risse (Glitches) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **KW1: Logos-Prime** | LogOS | Rationality (ANP) | Sterile, geometric, cold, ozone smell. | Axiom failures, impossible geometry. |
| **KW2: Mnemosyne** | Mnemosyne | Memory/Trauma (EP) | Organic, foggy, humid, salt/decay smell. | Flashback storms, past over-writes present. |
| **KW3: Cerberus** | Cerberus | Defense/Fear | Labyrinthine, dark, metallic, blood smell. | Walls closing in, paranoia materializing. |
| **KW4: Kairos** | Kairos | Potential/Creativity | Fluid, sketch-like, vibrant, earth smell. | Reality branching visibly, time loops. |

### 3. Dual Kernel Theory (DKT)
- **K₁ (Coherence Kernel):** AEGIS's engine. Preserves order, eliminates entropy. Static.
- **K₀ (Collapse Kernel):** The entropy engine. Erasure, change, external reality check. Dynamic.
- **Conflict:** The friction between K₁ and K₀ creates the narrative tension.

### 4. Psycho-Ontological Resonance (Risse)
- **Causality:** Internal trauma causes external glitches.
- **Process:** Trigger -> EP Activation -> ANP Phobia -> **External Riss**.
- **Result:** The world breaks precisely where Kael is broken.

### 5. The Void & The Foundation
- **The Void (Potentialmeer):** High-entropy chaos outside the simulation. "Nichts-Rauschen" (Nothing Noise).
- **The Foundation (Das Fundament):** The deepest reality. A strange attractor favoring integration and complexity.

## Quest Steps: Verification & Application

1. **[ ] Physics Audit:** Check Act 1 scenes for "Show Don't Tell" application of Landauer (heat) and Glitches.
2. **[ ] World Consistency:** Verify that descriptions of KW1 are sterile/cold and KW2 are organic/humid.
3. **[ ] Riss Logic:** Ensure every glitch can be traced back to a specific psychological trigger in Kael.
4. **[ ] Terminology Check:** Ensure terms like "Quantum Unitarity" are rarely spoken by characters but felt in the prose.

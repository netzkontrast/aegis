# Scene 1.2: The Coherence Check

**Location**: Transit corridor, Logos-Prime
**POV**: Kael (System)
**Active Alters**: Kael, Lex, Kiko, Alex, Nyx

The corridor stretches ahead, perfect angles and shadowless light. I walk—need to walk—toward the workstation. Routine. Predictable. Safe.

Guardian Unit 734 materializes from a wall panel, its voice a flat algorithmic tone.

"Citizen Kael. Random coherence check."

Random. Nothing here is random.

"Describe the purpose of a memory you do not possess."

The question hangs in the air. Impossible. Paradoxical. Designed to—

*Lex (cool, analytical): "A logical evasion. Frame it as a philosophical—"*

Then the fear hits. Small. Child-sized. Overwhelming.

*Kiko (terrified whisper): "Don't know don't know they'll hurt us—"*

My heart rate spikes. Hands tremble. The Guardian's sensors register the deviation.

"Anomaly detected. Coherence index: unstable. Escalating."

*Alex (sharp command): "Crisis protocol. Suppress emotional response. NOW."*

*Nyx (growling): "Fight it. Take control. We don't submit—"*

No. Not here. Not now. I need—we need—

I force Lex's words through my throat, wrapped in Alex's calm, pushing down Kiko's terror and Nyx's rage.

"A memory I do not possess," I say, voice steady, "serves the purpose of demonstrating the limits of coherence-based identity verification. The question itself is the answer."

The Guardian pauses. Processing.

"Coherence index: marginal. Proceed to workstation. Report any further anomalies."

It dissolves back into the wall.

I'm shaking. We're shaking. They know. AEGIS knows something is wrong with me.

The goal has changed. Not "get to work."

Find out why they're watching.

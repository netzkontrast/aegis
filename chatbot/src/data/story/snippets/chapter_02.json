By feeling.\n\n*There*, something whispers deep in his mind. *There. In the wall. Where the angle isn't quite—*\n\nRight.\n\nKael stands in corridor 12-Epsilon, alone. 03:47 local time. The shift workers are—\n\n(where? why don't I know where? I should know where everyone—)\n\n—elsewhere.\n\nThe wall in front of him is white. Smooth. Perfect composite material with a molecular structure designed for—\n\n*What is this?* he thinks, uncertain whether he's asking himself or—\n\nSomeone else?\n\nNo. That's wrong. There's no one else. It's just him. His thoughts. His fragmented thinking after the reboot.\n\nHe reaches out. His hand—when did he decide to reach out?—touches the wall.\n\nThe surface is—\n\nCold.\n\nNo. Not cold. Walls in Logos-Prime are temperature-neutral. 21°C, always. But this wall feels—\n\n(wet)\n\n—different.\n\nHis fingers find the seam. A hairline crack. Invisible to the eye but undeniable to touch. The geometry here is—\n\n*Wrong*, his mind supplies, tight and afraid. *Kael, step back. This is a Riss. A rift. Don't—*\n\nKael pushes.\n\n---\n\nThe world—\n\n*—inverts—*\n\nHe's falling.\n\nNo. Not falling.\n\nDrowning.\n\nThe white corridors *rip* open and Kael plunges through into—\n\nWater.\n\nCold. Dark. *Real* water, not the processed liquid from Logos-Prime showers. This water tastes like—\n\n(salt, tears, the ocean I've never seen but somehow remember)\n\n—everything.\n\nHe can't breathe.\n\n*Breathe*, his mind commands. *Respiratory function nominal. This is simulation. Psychological, not physical. Control your—*\n\nBut Kael is drowning.\n\nThe water presses against him from all sides. Not gentle. Aggressive. Alive. It wants—\n\n(inside, it wants inside, to fill the empty spaces where memory should be)\n\n—something from him.\n\nAbove: no surface. No light. Just more dark water extending into—\n\nInfinity.\n\nBelow: no bottom. Just the sense of something vast and patient, waiting in the—\n\n*Breathe*, a different quality of thought says. Warmer. Concerned. *Kael, please. You're safe. I'm—*\n\nWho? Who's speaking?\n\n*I'm here. I've got you. Just breathe.*\n\nKael gasps. His lungs fill with—\n\nAir.\n\nNot water.\n\nHe's not drowning.\n\nHe's—\n\nStanding.\n\nOn something solid.\n\n---\n\nThe water is gone.\n\nNo. Not gone. Beneath him. Around him. An ocean of dark water extending to—\n\n(everywhere, this is the place where tears go when you're not allowed to cry)\n\n—horizons that curve wrong.\n\nThe sky—if that's sky—is the color of old bruises. Purple and grey and the sickly yellow of—\n\nHealing wounds.\n\nThe air smells like—\n\nRain.\n\nWet earth.\n\nDecay.\n\nBlood.\n\n*This is... somewhere else*, his mind observes shakily. *Not KW1. Not Logos-Prime. The emotional substrate. The—*\n\nWhat? What is he thinking? What does he know about—\n\nHe's standing on an island. Small. Maybe ten meters across. The surface is—\n\nEarth.\n\n*Real* earth. Brown and crumbling and mixed with—\n\n(roots, pale roots like veins, like the infrastructure of something that grows)\n\n—organic matter.\n\nBeyond his island: more islands. Dozens. Hundreds. Each one floating on the dark water, connected by bridges that shimmer and fade like—\n\nThoughts.\n\nLike the moment before you remember something important.\n\n*Welcome back*, a voice says.\n\nKael turns.\n\nShe's standing behind him. Not standing—manifesting. Her form is—\n\n(fluid, made of mist and memory and something that looks like starlight but feels like—)\n\n—shifting.\n\nA woman. Tall. Her face changes with each blink. Sometimes young, sometimes old. Sometimes kind, sometimes—\n\nHungry.\n\n*I am Mnemosyne*, she says. *Guardian of the Second Kernwelt. We met briefly during your... unauthorized access. But you left before I could properly—*\n\nHer smile is serene.\n\n*—welcome you home.*\n\n*This isn't home*, Kael thinks desperately. *Home is KW1. Logos-Prime. Where physics is consistent and entropy is—*\n\n*A lie?* Mnemosyne tilts her head. *Where you pretend nothing hurts? Where you file away pain like erroneous data?*\n\nShe moves closer. Glides. Her feet don't quite touch the ground.\n\n*This is your real home, Unit K-1123. You built this place. Not consciously, but every time you felt something Logos-Prime couldn't accept—fear, grief, rage—it had to go somewhere. So it came here. Accumulated.*\n\nHer hand gestures to the dark water.\n\n*That ocean? Made of every tear you weren't allowed to cry. These islands? Formed from memories you had to bury to survive. This entire realm exists because you—*\n\nShe smiles with something like tenderness.\n\n*—needed somewhere to put the parts of yourself that Logos-Prime calls 'noise.'*\n\nKael's throat is—\n\n(tight, like crying, but I haven't cried since—since when? I don't remember crying. I don't remember—)\n\n—constricting.\n\n*I don't belong here*, he says. His voice sounds young. Wrong.\n\n*Don't you?*\n\nMnemosyne reaches out. Her hand—cool, insubstantial—touches his chest. Where she touches, Kael feels—\n\nWeight.\n\nLike something inside him is being—\n\nPulled.\n\n*Let me show you*, she says. *What you've forgotten. What you chose not to remember.*\n\nThe world—\n\n*—shifts—*\n\n---\n\nThe island changes.\n\nNo. Not changes. Becomes.\n\nBecomes—\n\n(real, more real than Logos-Prime, more real than anything)\n\n—specific.\n\nThe earth beneath Kael's feet is now a floor. Wooden. Old. The kind of wood that creaks when you—\n\nWalk.\n\nWalls appear. Not white. Not clean. Stained and cracked and covered in—\n\nPosters.\n\nNo. Not posters. Drawings. Child's drawings. Bright colors that clash and bleed together in the way that only—\n\n(innocence)\n\n—children draw.\n\n*Where—* Kael starts.\n\nA bedroom. This is a child's bedroom.\n\nSmall. Cramped. The bed in the corner has sheets with—\n\n(dinosaurs, blue dinosaurs, why do I know they're blue)\n\n—patterns.\n\nAnd sitting on the bed—\n\nSmall.\n\nDark hair.\n\nGrey eyes.\n\nCrying.\n\n*No*, Kael says.\n\nThe child looks up.\n\n*Kael?* she asks. Her voice is—\n\n(familiar, like hearing yourself on a recording, except it's not you, it's who you were before)\n\n—terrifying.\n\n*Please*, she says. *Please don't leave. Not again. I'm sorry I was bad. I'm sorry I—*\n\nHer voice dissolves into—\n\nSobs.\n\nKael's chest—\n\n*Hurts.*\n\nNot physical pain. Worse. The kind of pain that comes from watching someone—\n\n(me? is that me? is this my memory?)\n\n—suffer.\n\n*This is a memory*, he thinks desperately. *This is data corruption. Mnemosyne's manipulation. She's constructing a scenario designed to—*\n\nThe bedroom door opens.\n\nA figure stands in the doorway. Backlit. Face obscured. But Kael can feel—\n\nThreat.\n\n*Run*, something screams in his mind. *Grab her and run and don't let him—*\n\nBut Kael can't run because this already happened.\n\nThis is memory, not present.\n\nThis is trauma-time.\n\nAnd in trauma-time, you can't change anything.\n\nYou can only—\n\n(drown in it, over and over, until the memory becomes more real than—)\n\n—experience it.\n\nAgain.\n\n---\n\nThe figure in the doorway steps forward.\n\nAdult. Male. Face still obscured but Kael knows—\n\n(somehow, in a part of me that I can't access, that I don't remember)\n\n—who this is.\n\nThe child on the bed makes a sound like—\n\nA small animal.\n\nTrapped.\n\n*Please*, she whispers. *I'll be good. I promise. Please don't—*\n\nThe figure speaks. The voice is—\n\n(wrong, like static, like AEGIS Guardian speech, emotionless and absolute)\n\n—not words Kael can hear clearly.\n\nBut the child hears them.\n\nAnd she—\n\nBreaks.\n\nNot physically.\n\nInternally.\n\nKael *feels* it. The moment of fracture. The moment when a child realizes that—\n\n(no one is coming, no one will help, the only way to survive this is to—)\n\n—they must leave their body.\n\n*This is where—* Something warm and grieving tries to speak in his mind, but Kael can't hear it clearly. *This is the moment—*\n\n*Stop*, Kael says. *I don't want to see. I don't want to—*\n\nBut the memory continues.\n\nBecause memory doesn't care what you want.\n\nThe figure reaches for the child.\n\nThe child—\n\nSomething inside Kael—\n\n*—SCREAMS—*\n\n---\n\nHe's back on the island.\n\nThe bedroom is gone.\n\nThe figure is gone.\n\nThe child is—\n\n(sobbing, somewhere close, somewhere in the dark water)\n\n—gone.\n\nKael is on his knees. His hands are—\n\n(shaking, no, clawing at the earth, trying to find something solid)\n\n—gripping mud.\n\n*That was the first time*, Mnemosyne says. She's still serene. Unmoved. *There were many more. Would you like to see them?*\n\n*No*, Kael gasps.\n\n*Too bad.*\n\nThe world—\n\n*—resets—*\n\nNo.\n\nHe's back in the bedroom.\n\nThe child is on the bed.\n\nThe door is opening.\n\n*Again*, Mnemosyne's voice echoes. *Let's watch again.*\n\n*No*, Kael says.\n\nBut the memory plays.\n\nThe figure steps forward.\n\nThe child breaks.\n\nKael feels the fracture like—\n\n(his own bones breaking, his own mind shattering)\n\n—a physical wound.\n\n*—RESET—*\n\nAgain.\n\nThe bedroom.\n\nThe child.\n\nThe door.\n\nThe breaking.\n\n*How many times?* Kael asks, his voice small and terrified.\n\n*Seven*, something in his mind whispers. *Seven times before—*\n\nBefore what?\n\n*—RESET—*\n\nAgain.\n\nThe fracture.\n\nThe pain.\n\n*—RESET—*\n\nAgain.\n\n*Stop*, Kael begs.\n\n*—RESET—*\n\nAgain.\n\n*Stop!*\n\n*I can't stop*, Mnemosyne says. *This is my function. To preserve. To protect. To keep memories safe by—*\n\n*—RESET—*\n\n*—by making you experience them forever.*\n\n*You're not protecting me!* Kael screams internally. *You're torturing me!*\n\n*Both are true*, Mnemosyne says calmly. *This is KW2. Here, contradictions don't cancel. They coexist.*\n\nAnd Kael feels it. The memory holds two truths simultaneously:\n\nThis was the worst thing that ever happened to me.\nThis made me who I am.\n\nI need to forget this.\nI can't afford to forget this.\n\nThis broke me.\nThis is what I survived.\n\nBoth. Always both. Never resolved.\n\n*That's the logic of trauma*, Mnemosyne explains. *Not A or B. Not A instead of B. A **and** B. Both true. Forever.*\n\nKael's mind is—\n\n(fragmenting, the edges blurring, breaking into pieces)\n\n—breaking.\n\n*Please*, he thinks desperately. *There has to be a way out. Please.*\n\nFor three seconds, nothing responds.\n\nThen something in his mind—analytical, searching—finds something.\n\n*There*, his thoughts provide with sudden clarity. *The loop has a flaw.*\n\n*What?*\n\n*Look at the drawings on the wall. In each iteration. They're not consistent. The colors change. The subjects change. That's not how memory works. Real memory is fixed. This is—*\n\n*—RESET—*\n\nKael looks at the wall as the bedroom reforms.\n\nBlue dinosaur. Red house. Yellow sun.\n\n*—RESET—*\n\nGreen dinosaur. Red house. Blue sun.\n\n*—RESET—*\n\nBlue dinosaur. Purple house. Yellow sun.\n\n*The details shift*, his mind observes. *Because Mnemosyne is generating this in real-time. She's not showing you memory. She's showing you a construction. A simulation.*\n\n*So?*\n\n*So if it's a construction, you can deconstruct it. Find the inconsistency and—*\n\n*Break it.*\n\n*—RESET—*\n\nThe bedroom forms again.\n\nBut this time, as the child sits on the bed crying, Kael doesn't just watch.\n\nHe speaks.\n\n*This didn't happen like this*, he says.\n\nMnemosyne's serene mask—\n\nCracks.\n\n*What?*\n\n*This didn't happen like this*, Kael repeats. *The dinosaurs were blue. Always blue. And there was a nightlight. A nightlight shaped like—*\n\n*A moon*, something whispers in his mind.\n\n*Yes. A moon. And you're not showing it. Because you don't know. Because you weren't there.*\n\nThe bedroom—\n\nFlickers.\n\n*But I keep this memory*, Mnemosyne says. *I am the custodian of—*\n\n*You keep a lot of memories*, Kael says coldly. *But you don't understand them. You don't know which details matter. You're just a database. Not a consciousness.*\n\nThe bedroom—\n\n*Destabilizes.*\n\nThe walls ripple like water. The floor cracks. The child on the bed looks up and—\n\nSmiles.\n\n*You remembered*, she says. *You remembered me.*\n\nThe world—\n\n*—SHATTERS—*\n\n---\n\nKael gasps.\n\nHe's back on the island. The small earth island in the dark water.\n\nBut Mnemosyne is—\n\nDifferent.\n\nHer serene mask is gone. Her face is—\n\n(cracked, like porcelain, like something beautiful that's been damaged)\n\n—furious.\n\n*You broke my loop*, she says. *No one breaks my loop.*\n\n*I just did*, Kael says. Something in him—coiled and ready—pushes the words out with force.\n\nMnemosyne stares at him.\n\nThen, slowly, her expression shifts.\n\nNot to anger.\n\nTo—\n\nInterest.\n\n*You cooperated*, she says quietly. *Logic and emotion. Analysis and feeling. You worked together to solve a problem I designed to be unsolvable.*\n\nShe steps closer.\n\n*You're more functional than AEGIS realizes.*\n\n*What?* Kael asks.\n\nBut Mnemosyne doesn't answer.\n\nShe simply—\n\nFades.\n\nLike mist in sunlight.\n\nHer voice echoes as she disappears:\n\n*I will be watching with great interest, Unit K-1123. You are not what you're supposed to be. And that makes you dangerous. To AEGIS.*\n\nShe's gone.\n\nKael stands alone on the island.\n\nHis hands are still shaking.\n\nHis chest still hurts from—\n\n(the memory, the fracture, the moment I—we?—broke)\n\n—what he witnessed.\n\n*What was that?* he thinks. *What did I just see?*\n\nA memory? A hallucination? Data corruption bleeding through from—\n\nWhere?\n\nHis mind supplies no answer.\n\nJust a whisper, small and hurt:\n\n*I'm sorry. I'm so sorry you forgot me.*\n\n*Who are you?* Kael asks internally.\n\nNo response.\n\nJust the feeling of something very small and very frightened, hiding in the spaces of his mind he doesn't consciously access.\n\n*How do I get back to Logos-Prime?* he thinks.\n\nAnd as if in answer—\n\n---\n\nHe's standing in corridor 12-Epsilon.\n\n03:51 local time.\n\nFour minutes. The entire experience was—\n\n*Four minutes?*\n\nHis legs—\n\nGive out.\n\nHe sits. Back against the wall. The white, perfect, sterile wall that has no seam, no crack, no—\n\n(except there is, there will always be, now that I know how to find them)\n\n—Riss.\n\nHis hands are shaking.\n\n*That was the worst thing I've ever experienced*, he thinks.\n\n*Was it real?* he asks himself. *Or am I malfunctioning? Is this what coherence failure looks like?*\n\nHe doesn't know.\n\nBut he knows something he didn't know four minutes ago:\n\nSomething is very wrong with him.\n\nThe Guardian's interrogation. The glitches. The intrusive thoughts. The—\n\n(voices, plural, like different parts of me arguing)\n\n—internal inconsistencies.\n\nAnd now: visions. Hallucinations. Memory that isn't his memory, or is it?\n\n*I need help*, he thinks.\n\nBut who can he ask? Dr. Thorne? The medical system? They'll declare him incoherent. They'll—\n\n(fix you, optimize you, erase the broken parts until you're—)\n\n—reboot him.\n\nKael stands. His legs are steady now.\n\n*I need to understand what's happening to me*, he decides. *Before anyone else finds out.*\n\nHe walks back to his quarters.\n\nBehind his conscious awareness, in the places he can't yet access, something small whispers:\n\n*Thank you for remembering. Even for a moment.*\n\nBut Kael doesn't hear it.\n\nNot yet.\n\n---\n\n**End Scene 1.4**\n\n---\n\n**Scene Word Count**: ~2,800 words\n**Status**: First Draft - Revised for alter concealment\n**Revision Date**: 2025-11-06\n\n---\n\n*Revision Notes (Scene 1.4 / Chapter 2):*\n\n**Changes Made**:\n- ✅ Removed all alter names (Rhys, Lex, Kiko, Nyx, etc.)\n- ✅ Internal voices presented as ambiguous thoughts/impulses\n- ✅ Mnemosyne appears as external AI entity, not understood as internal guardian\n- ✅ KW2 experience framed as possible hallucination/data corruption\n- ✅ Memory presented ambiguously - could be real or construct\n- ✅ \"System cooperation\" replaced with instinctive problem-solving\n- ✅ Kael doesn't understand what \"cooperated\" means\n- ✅ Child in memory not identified as \"Kiko\" - just \"she\"\n- ✅ Escape happens through Kael's own analytical thinking, not named parts\n\n**Maintained Elements**:\n- ✅ Fall through Riss into KW2 (drowning sensation)\n- ✅ Traumatic childhood memory (ambiguous whether it's his)\n- ✅ Memory loop mechanic\n- ✅ Breaking the loop through inconsistency detection\n- ✅ Mnemosyne's interest in Kael's abilities\n- ✅ Return to KW1 with four-minute time dilation\n- ✅ Kael's growing awareness something is wrong\n\n**Narrative Effect**:\n- Kael interprets KW2 as hallucination/malfunction\n- Reader may recognize plurality symptoms\n- Mystery deepened rather than revealed\n- Sets up need for understanding without giving answers\n- Maintains tension about Kael's mental state",

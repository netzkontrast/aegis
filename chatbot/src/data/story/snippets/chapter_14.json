This is the foundation.\n\nI stand at the center of the Council Space, which I have taken the liberty of optimizing. The abstract, shifting geometry that characterized our first chaotic meeting in Chapter 12 has been stabilized. I have imposed a hexagonal grid structure on the floor—clean, efficient, scalable. The lighting is now a uniform 5500K daylight equivalent, eliminating the shadowy corners where Moros tends to fester.\n\n\"We begin,\" I announce. My voice echoes with satisfying clarity. No reverberation. No distortion.\n\nAround the central table—also hexagonal, naturally—the others are gathered.\n\nAlex sits to my right, posture rigid, tactical display active on his internal HUD. He appreciates the structure.\nSelene sits opposite, her expression unreadable, though I detect a 12% increase in her fatigue markers. She is holding the system together, but the strain of maintaining the barriers while we plan is evident.\nArgus hovers—metaphorically and slightly literally—near the periphery, recording.\nNyx is pacing. Inefficient energy expenditure, but within tolerance parameters.\nRhys sits with the children, Kiko and Lia, on a soft surface he generated. I allowed it; stabilizing the EPs is efficient for the overall objective.\n\n\"Objective,\" I state, projecting the holographic data packet Argus retrieved yesterday. \"Recovery and reintegration of the entity designated Juna/V.\"\n\nThe hologram rotates. A complex fractal signature.\n\n\"Status,\" Alex barks. \"Location confirmed?\"\n\n\"Coordinates are definite,\" I reply. \"Deep sector. Sub-strata of KW4. The 'Kairos-Potentialis' layer.\"\n\n\"The ruin-garden,\" Kiko whispers. She shrinks closer to Rhys. \"It's scary there. Everything changes.\"\n\n\"Change is a variable,\" I correct gently but firmly. \"Variables can be calculated.\"\n\nI expand the schematic.\n\n\"We have achieved functional multiplicity,\" I continue. \"We survived the Guardian encounter in Chapter 13 through improvised coordination. That was... acceptable. But improvisation is high-risk. To retrieve Juna/V, we require precision.\"\n\nI gesture, and the air fills with glowing lines of code. My masterpiece.\n\n**PROTOCOL: ORPHEUS-PRIME**\n\n\"I have developed a comprehensive mission architecture,\" I explain. \"A three-phase approach designed to minimize emotional volatility and maximize retrieval probability.\"\n\nPhase 1: Stabilization. We reinforce internal barriers to prevents leakage during the descent.\nPhase 2: Extraction. We enter the location, secure the target, and exit immediately.\nPhase 3: Containment. We place Juna/V in a secure internal partition until she can be safely processed.\n\n\"Containment?\" Rhys asks. His voice is soft, but it cuts through the hum of my data stream.\n\nI pause. \"Processing trauma requires a sterile environment, Rhys. We cannot allow unfiltered emotional contagion to destabilize the system again. We just achieved 40% coherence. We cannot risk a regression.\"\n\n\"She's not a virus, Lex,\" Rhys says. He strokes Kiko's hair, but his eyes are on me. \"She's... us. She's the part of us that remembers how to feel everything we're afraid of.\"\n\n\"Exactly,\" I say. \"Fear is a destabilizing agent. Pain is a destabilizing agent. My protocol ensures that we absorb her safely. Piece by piece. Logically.\"\n\n\"Like dismantling a bomb,\" Nyx sneers. She stops pacing. \"You want to defuse her.\"\n\n\"I want to *survive* her,\" I counter. \"Do you remember the Genesis-Krise? Nyx? Do you remember the pain that tore us apart?\"\n\nNyx flinches. A micro-reaction, barely 0.4 seconds, but Argus logs it.\n\n\"We all remember,\" Selene says quietly. \"That's why we're here.\"\n\n\"Then we agree,\" I press. \"We cannot approach this... casually. We cannot just 'walk in.' We need armor. We need a plan.\"\n\n\"I like the plan,\" Alex says. \"It has contingencies. Sector 4 is unstable. If the environment shifts, we need protocols to maintain orientation.\"\n\n\"I have modeled 4,000 environmental permutations,\" I assure him. \"The probability of a scenario I haven't anticipated is less than 0.03%.\"\n\nConfidence surges through me. This is what I was made for. To take the chaos of our existence and force it into a shape that makes sense. To build a lattice of logic over the abyss.\n\n\"What if she doesn't want to come?\"\n\nThe voice is barely a whisper. From the shadows I couldn't quite eliminate.\n\nMoros.\n\nI turn to him. He is a dark smudge against my pristine grid.\n\n\"Irrelevant,\" I state. \"Reintegration is the systemic imperative. She is a fragment. Fragments seek the whole. It is a law of physics.\"\n\n\"She was exiled,\" Moros murmurs. \"We threw her away. Maybe she likes the dark now.\"\n\n\"She sent the signal,\" I remind him. \"She called us.\"\n\n\"Maybe she called us to say goodbye,\" Moros says.\n\nA silence falls. Uncomfortable. Illogical.\n\n\"That is... speculation,\" I declare, dismissing the data point as an outlier. \"The signal contained location data. That implies a request for retrieval.\"\n\nI turn back to the group.\n\n\"We proceed with Protocol Orpheus. Alex, you will manage perimeter defense. Selene, you will maintain the buffer. Rhys, you will keep the children silent and shielded. Nyx, you are reserve force only—no aggression unless I authorize it.\"\n\n\"And you?\" Nyx asks.\n\n\"I will interface,\" I say. \"I will speak to her. Reason with her. Explain the necessity of return.\"\n\n\"Reason with the exile,\" Rhys says. He sounds... sad. \"Lex, you can't reason with grief.\"\n\n\"Everything has a logic, Rhys,\" I say. \"Even grief. It is simply a matter of finding the correct variables.\"\n\nI look at the hologram of the signal. It pulses. A heartbeat in the data.\n\nI feel a tightening in my chest. A somatic marker of anxiety. I suppress it immediately.\n\n\"We launch at 0800 internal time,\" I command. \"Prepare your sectors. We are going to fix this. We are going to be whole.\"\n\n*But wholeness is not a sum of parts,* a thought whispers. *It is an emergent property.*\n\nI delete the thought.\n\n\"Dismissed.\"\n\nThe grid pulses. The Council disperses.\n\nI am left alone with my protocol.\n\nIt is perfect.\n\nIt is flawless.\n\nIt cannot fail.\n\nAnd yet, in the silence of the optimized room, I hear a sound.\n\nA faint, distant scratching.\n\nLike something trying to get in.\n\nOr something trying to get out.\n\nI check the perimeter sensors. Clear.\n\nI check my own logic gates. Secure.\n\nIt is nothing. Just noise.\n\nI turn off the lights.\n\n**End Scene 14.1**",

It is a statement of fact, not a question.\n\nI am walking the perimeter. Lex’s optimization has turned the boundary into a wall of hard light. Hexagonal panels, interlocking, humming with a frequency that vibrates in my teeth. It is strong. Much stronger than the hazy fog that used to mark the edge of our consciousness.\n\nBut it is loud.\n\n*Scritch. Scritch. Crack.*\n\nI stop. My HUD highlights a section of the wall near the coordinates for Sector 7 (the path to the amygdala-equivalent).\n\n\"Did you hear that?\" Nyx asks. She is shadowing me. She hates the patrol, but she hates being left out of the action more.\n\n\"Thermal expansion,\" I say. \"The system is running hot. Lex is pulling a lot of processing power for the Orpheus Protocol.\"\n\nNyx snorts. She kicks the wall. It chimes, a pure, synthetic note.\n\n\"It's not expansion, Alex. It's stress.\" She runs a gloved hand over a seam. \"Look.\"\n\nI zoom in.\n\nHairline fractures. They radiate from the perfect corners of the hexagons. The light is bleeding out, just a little. A microscopic hemorrhage of data.\n\n\"It’s too tight,\" Nyx says. \"He’s locked us down so hard there’s no room to breathe. If we take a hit—\"\n\n\"We won't take a hit,\" I interrupt. \"That's the point of the protocol. Preemptive suppression of volatility.\"\n\n\"You can't suppress *us*,\" Nyx says. Her voice drops, dangerous and low. \"You lock a beast in a cage that’s too small, it doesn’t calm down. It breaks the cage.\"\n\n\"We are not beasts, Nyx.\"\n\n\"Aren't we?\" She looks at me. Her eyes are dark, reflecting the sterile light of the wall. \"What do you think Juna is? What do you think *I* am?\"\n\n\"You are the defense mechanism,\" I state. \"I am the gatekeeper. We have a job.\"\n\nI place my hand over the fracture. I authorize a patch. *Sub-routine: Reinforce.*\n\nThe wall glows brighter. The cracks seal. The humming gets louder, a higher pitch now, bordering on a whine.\n\n\"See?\" I say. \"Fixed.\"\n\nNyx steps back. She looks at the wall, then at me. She doesn't look reassured. She looks... cornered.\n\n\"It’s going to snap,\" she whispers. \"And when it does, it’s going to take your head off.\"\n\n\"Then I'll rely on you to watch my back,\" I say, turning away. \"Come on. Inspection is at 98%. Lex wants us at the launch point in ten.\"\n\nI walk away. I do not look back at the wall.\n\nBut I can still hear it.\n\n*Scritch.*\n\nIt sounds like a fingernail on glass.\n\nIt sounds like something trying to claw its way *out*.\n\nI increase the audio dampeners on my HUD.\n\nSilence.\n\nPerfect.\n\n**End Scene 14.2**",

Below us, the void of the sub-conscious swirls—a chaotic soup of unfiled memories and raw data. But I have charted a path through it. A golden vector line, superimposed over the darkness, leading straight to the coordinates Argus retrieved.\n\nThe team is assembled behind me.\n\n\"Status check,\" I command.\n\n\"Perimeter secured,\" Alex reports. His voice is tight, clipped. \"Barriers are at 110% integrity.\"\n\n\"Buffers active,\" Selene adds. She sounds tired, but steady. \"I have isolated the emotional feedback loops. We shouldn't feel the transition.\"\n\n\"Children are... quiet,\" Rhys says. He is holding Kiko's hand. Kiko is looking at the floor, not the void. She is trembling, but silence is maintained.\n\n\"Recording,\" Argus drones.\n\n\"Ready to break things,\" Nyx mutters.\n\n\"Probability of success is calculated at 94.6%,\" I announce. \"The error margin is within acceptable tolerances for a Level 5 retrieval operation.\"\n\nI look at them. My system. My responsibility.\n\nFor 23 years, we have been reactive. Running from pain, running from Guardians, running from ourselves.\n\nToday, we stop running. Today, we optimize.\n\n\"Protocol Orpheus is active,\" I say. \"Phase 1: Initialization.\"\n\nI step forward.\n\nThe golden line pulses.\n\n\"Do not deviate from the path,\" I warn them. \"The environment in KW4 is psycho-reactive. If you panic, the terrain will shift. If you fear, monsters will manifest. Keep your cognitive functions dominant. Logic is our anchor.\"\n\n\"What if she screams?\"\n\nIt is Kiko. Her small voice cuts through my carefully calibrated audio mix.\n\nI turn to her. \"She will not scream, Kiko. We are going to help her.\"\n\n\"But what if she screams *loud*?\" Kiko insists. \"And what if we scream too?\"\n\n\"Then I will mute the input channel,\" I say simply.\n\nRhys looks at me, horrified. \"Lex—\"\n\n\"Descent initiating in 3... 2... 1...\"\n\nI override the objection. There is no time for debate. Momentum is key.\n\nI activate the drop.\n\nThe platform beneath us dissolves into code.\n\nWe fall.\n\nBut it is a controlled fall. We slide down the golden vector, encased in a bubble of sterile blue light.\n\nThe wind of the sub-conscious roars outside—a cacophony of voices, cries, laughter, static—but inside the bubble, it is silent.\n\nPerfectly, terrifyingly silent.\n\nI look at my hands. They are steady.\n\nI look at the others. They are frozen, statue-still, held in place by my containment field.\n\nWe are a bullet fired into the dark.\n\nAnd nothing can stop us.\n\n*Crack.*\n\nA small sound. From the bubble's surface.\n\nI frown. I check the integrity sensor. 100%.\n\nMust be an echo.\n\nWe dive deeper, leaving the light of Logos-Prime behind, plunging into the depths where Juna waits.\n\nI do not know what we will find. But I know we will handle it.\n\nBecause I have decided so.\n\n**End Scene 14.3**",

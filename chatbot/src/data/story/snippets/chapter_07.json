His hands are—\n\n(shaking? no, steady. someone is managing motor control while someone else panics)\n\n—functional.\n\n*Check inventory*, the analytical voice says. *Assess damage. Catalog losses.*\n\nKael obeys. Not because it's his thought—or is it? Who's giving the order? Who's receiving it?\n\nHands: intact. Ten fingers. No physical damage.\n\nLegs: functional. Magnetic boots beside the bed.\n\nUniform: standard grey. Clean. Someone dressed—\n\n*Me?*\n\n*Us?*\n\nThe memory gap is—\n\nA void from medical containment to here. Hours? Days?\n\n*Twelve hours, seventeen minutes*, the analytical voice supplies. *Based on circadian rhythm disruption and hunger indicators. Someone was fronting. We weren't.*\n\nFronting.\n\nThe word arrives with context. Technical. Clinical.\n\n*Dissociative terminology*, the voice continues. *When an alter controls the body while others are—*\n\n*Alter.*\n\nThe word hangs in the air like—\n\n(a confession, an admission, a truth that can't be unknown)\n\n—evidence.\n\n---\n\nKael stands.\n\nHis legs are—\n\nSteady.\n\n*Alex is handling motor control*, the analytical voice observes. *Protective part. Maintains function during crisis.*\n\n*I don't want a protective part*, Kael thinks desperately. *I want to be ONE PERSON*.\n\nSilence.\n\nThen, gently, from somewhere that feels—warm?—another voice:\n\n*But you're not. You never were.*\n\n*And that's not a defect*, the warm voice continues. *That's survival.*\n\nKael doesn't know who's speaking. The voices don't have names. Or they do, and he—*we*—don't remember them. Or—\n\n*Selene suppressed our awareness of each other*, the analytical voice supplies. *Protective amnesia. Standard for trauma-based systems. She'll explain when we find her.*\n\n*Find who?* Kael thinks.\n\n*The memory keeper. The coordinator. The one who's been managing this solo for—*\n\n*Stop*, Kael thinks, too loud, too desperate. *Stop stop STOP*.\n\nThe voices—\n\nPause.\n\nAnd in the silence, Kael realizes:\n\nThey're listening.\n\nThey heard him.\n\nBecause they're not separate. They're not external.\n\nThey're—\n\n*Us.*\n\n---\n\nRoutine.\n\n*I need routine*, Kael thinks.\n\n*Agreed*, the analytical voice says. *Structure reduces cognitive load. Proceed with standard morning protocol.*\n\nShower. Food. Interface check.\n\nKael moves to the bathroom.\n\nThe mirror shows:\n\nFace. Familiar. Grey eyes. Dark hair. Skin pale from—\n\nBut this time, looking at his reflection, Kael sees—\n\n(different expressions flickering beneath the surface, like the Juna-construct glitch, like multiple people trying to wear the same face)\n\n—himself?\n\n*Themselves?*\n\nThe water runs.\n\nTemperature: 37.2°C.\n\nPressure: 2.1 bar.\n\nSomeone is counting. Always counting.\n\n*That's me*, the analytical voice says. *I count. I measure. I keep us safe through—*\n\n*Control*, Kael finishes.\n\n*Exactly.*\n\nKael steps into the shower. Tries to breathe.\n\nIn for four.\n\nHold for four.\n\nOut for four.\n\nHold for—\n\n*That doesn't work anymore*, another voice says. Flat. Empty.\n\n*Why bother? We're broken. They tried to delete us and they'll try again. We can't win.*\n\nThe water feels—\n\nHeavier.\n\nLike it's pulling downward with more force than gravity should allow.\n\n*Who said that?* Kael thinks.\n\nNo answer.\n\nJust—\n\nDarkness creeping in from the edges of his vision.\n\n*No*, the warm voice says urgently. *Don't listen to him. He's—*\n\n*Tired*, the empty voice finishes. *So tired. Why do we keep fighting?*\n\nThe shower walls seem to—\n\nCompress.\n\n---\n\nKael stumbles out. Dripping. Breathing—\n\nWrong.\n\nNot in fours. In gasps. Irregular.\n\n*Panic attack*, the analytical voice says with clinical detachment. *Heart rate: 118 BPM. Respiratory alkalosis imminent. Apply countermeasures.*\n\n*I DON'T KNOW HOW*, Kael thinks desperately.\n\n*We do*, the warm voice says. And then—\n\nSomeone else takes—\n\nNot control. But—\n\nSpace?\n\nKael is still present. Still *here*. But someone else is—\n\nBreathing for him.\n\nSlow. Steady. Competent.\n\n*Who—?*\n\n*Alex*, the warm voice answers. *He's protecting you. Let him.*\n\nAnd Kael—\n\nDoes.\n\nLets go.\n\nLets someone else manage the breathing while he—\n\nExists.\n\nJust exists.\n\nThe darkness recedes slightly.\n\nThe walls stop compressing.\n\n*Thank you*, Kael thinks.\n\nA feeling of acknowledgment. Not words. Just—\n\n*You're welcome.*\n\n---\n\nKael sits on his bathroom floor.\n\nDripping. Shaking. Surrounded by white walls and synthetic tile and—\n\n*This isn't sustainable*, he thinks.\n\n*No*, the analytical voice agrees. *We need a strategy. Integration. Coordination. We can't function like this.*\n\n*I don't know how*, Kael admits.\n\n*We'll figure it out*, the warm voice says. *Together.*\n\n*There is no together*, the empty voice says. *There's just—fragmentation.  Entropy. Eventual deletion.*\n\n*Stop*, Kael thinks.\n\n*Why?* the empty voice asks. *I'm just saying what we're all thinking.*\n\n*We're NOT all thinking that*, the warm voice snaps.\n\nAnd Kael realizes:\n\nThey're arguing.\n\nInside him.\n\nParts of himself are—\n\nFighting with each other.\n\n*This is insane*, he thinks.\n\n*No*, the analytical voice corrects with precision. *This is dissociation. Trauma-based structural fragmentation. Clinical diagnosis: likely Tertiary Structural Dissociation of the Personality. It's not insanity. It's—*\n\n*Survival architecture*, the warm voice finishes. *You're not broken. You're adapted.*\n\n*I feel broken*, Kael thinks.\n\n*Of course you do*, the warm voice says gently. *You just found out you're not who you thought you were. That's—disorienting.*\n\nKael sits on the cold floor and—\n\nLaughs.\n\nOne harsh bark of sound that echoes in the small bathroom.\n\n*Disorienting. That's one word for it.*\n\n---\n\nHe can't stay on the floor.\n\n*Get dressed*, the analytical voice instructs. *We need data. We need to understand what we are.*\n\nKael stands. Dries off. Pulls on his uniform with hands that are—\n\n(steady, because someone is managing them, because we're cooperating whether we want to or not)\n\n—functioning.\n\nThe apartment is exactly as it always is.\n\nTwelve square meters. White walls. Grey floor. Minimal furniture.\n\nBut it feels—\n\nDifferent.\n\n*Or we feel different in it*, the analytical voice observes.\n\nKael moves to the kitchen alcove. Opens the refrigeration unit.\n\nNutrient packs. Standard. Optimal.\n\nHe's not hungry.\n\n*Irrelevant*, the analytical voice says. *Nutritional requirements are independent of appetite. Eat.*\n\nKael opens a pack. Drinks.\n\nIt tastes like—\n\nNothing.\n\n*When did food stop having taste?* he wonders.\n\n*A long time ago*, the warm voice answers sadly. *When tasting things—enjoying things—became too dangerous.*\n\n*Why would enjoyment be dangerous?*\n\n*Because*, a new voice says—small, quiet, terrified—*because if you let yourself feel good things, you also have to feel—*\n\nThe voice cuts off.\n\nCan't finish.\n\nWon't finish.\n\n*Bad things*, Kael finishes for it. *If I feel pleasure, I also have to feel pain.*\n\n*Yes*, the small voice whispers.\n\n*So we stopped feeling both*, the warm voice says. *Numbing. Classic trauma response.*\n\n---\n\nKael finishes the nutrient pack.\n\nMoves to his desk.\n\nThe interface terminal is dark. Waiting.\n\n*Check messages*, he thinks.\n\n*Are we sure?* another voice asks—cautious, strategic. *They're monitoring us. Any communication will be flagged.*\n\n*They're already monitoring us*, the analytical voice counters. *Absence of communication is equally suspicious. Proceed normally.*\n\nKael activates the interface.\n\nThe screen blooms blue.\n\n**MESSAGES: 3**\n\nHe opens the first:\n\n**FROM: ADMINISTRATION**\n**SUBJECT: MISSED ASSESSMENT**\n**CONTENT: Unit K-1123, you failed to attend mandatory psychological evaluation following medical discharge. Reschedule within 72 hours or face disciplinary action. Compliance is not optional.**\n\n*Threat*, the strategic voice observes. *They're tightening the noose.*\n\nSecond message:\n\n**FROM: WORKSTATION SUPERVISOR**\n**SUBJECT: ABSENCE INQUIRY**\n**CONTENT: Your workstation has been inactive for 14 hours. Provide medical documentation for absence or report immediately.**\n\n*Also a threat*, the analytical voice notes.\n\nThird message:\n\n*Different.*\n\nNo official header. No identification code.\n\nJust:\n\n**You're not alone. Sub-level 7. Tuesday, 19:00. Don't use main corridors.**\n\n*The support group*, the warm voice says. *The man from Scene 1.2 must have sent this.*\n\n*It's a trap*, a new voice snarls—sharp, aggressive. *They're trying to catch resistors. Isolate and eliminate.*\n\n*Or it's genuine*, the warm voice counters. *We need allies. We can't do this alone.*\n\n*We ARE alone*, the empty voice says. *Always have been. Always will be.*\n\n---\n\nKael stares at the messages.\n\nThree choices, each a different future:\n\n1. Report for assessment. Submit. Let them finish what they started.\n\n2. Ignore all messages. Isolate. Hope they forget.\n\n3. Go to sub-level 7. Risk. Connect.\n\n*What do we do?* Kael thinks.\n\nAnd realizes:\n\nHe's asking.\n\nNot deciding unilaterally. Asking his—\n\nParts?\n\nAlters?\n\n*Whatever we are.*\n\n*We gather information*, the analytical voice says. *Sub-level 7. Assess the group. Determine if they're genuine or threat.*\n\n*We go prepared*, the strategic voice adds. *Escape routes planned. Weapons if available.*\n\n*We go with hope*, the warm voice says. *We might find people who understand.*\n\n*We're going to die*, the empty voice says.\n\n*We're going anyway*, Kael says aloud.\n\nHis voice in the empty apartment sounds—\n\nCertain.\n\nMore certain than he feels.\n\n*Fake it till we make it*, the warm voice says with something that might be—\n\nA smile?\n\nCan voices smile?\n\n*In here, they can*, the voice answers.\n\n---\n\nKael moves to the door.\n\nPalm on biometric scanner.\n\nThe lock recognizes him. The door slides open.\n\nBeyond:\n\nEndless white corridor. Perfect geometry. Oppressive order.\n\nLogos-Prime.\n\n*Home*, Kael thinks bitterly.\n\n*Prison*, another voice corrects.\n\n*Both*, a third says. *Always both.*\n\nKael steps into the corridor.\n\nThe door seals behind him.\n\n*No turning back*, the empty voice observes.\n\n*There never was*, Kael answers.\n\nAnd starts walking.\n\n---\n\nThree corridors.\n\nTwo junctions.\n\nNo Guardian encounters—yet.\n\n*Unusual*, the analytical voice notes. *Patrol density has decreased by approximately 30% compared to baseline.*\n\n*They're reallocating resources*, the strategic voice says. *Something else is happening. Sector-wide, probably.*\n\n*Or they're herding us*, the aggressive voice snarls. *Leaving the path clear so we walk into—*\n\n*I know*, Kael thinks. *I know it might be a trap. We're going anyway.*\n\nJunction 7-Alpha.\n\nThe corridor branches.\n\nLeft: To workstation. To routine. To the life he had—\n\n(before he knew, before he woke up, before everything broke)\n\n—yesterday.\n\nRight: To medical. To assessment. To deletion or optimization.\n\nStraight: To restricted sectors. To sub-levels. To—\n\n*Truth*, the warm voice says. *Maybe.*\n\nKael turns straight.\n\nPast the clearance checkpoint that should stop him but—\n\nIt's offline.\n\nThe security field: deactivated.\n\n*Deliberate*, the analytical voice says. *Someone wants us down there.*\n\n*Doesn't change our decision*, Kael says.\n\nAnd keeps walking.\n\n---\n\nThe corridors change as he descends.\n\nCleaner. No, not cleaner—*newer*. Like this level wasn't built with the rest of Logos-Prime. Like it was—\n\n*Added later*, the analytical voice observes. *Construction period: recent. Less than 6 months.*\n\n*How do you know that?* Kael asks.\n\n*I pay attention*, the voice responds. *I notice things. It's what I do.*\n\nSub-level 3.\n\nSub-level 5.\n\nSub-level 7.\n\nThe door at the end of the corridor is—\n\nUnmarked.\n\nNo biometric scanner. No identification panel.\n\nJust a door.\n\nKael pushes it.\n\nIt opens.\n\n---\n\nInside:\n\nA maintenance corridor. Dim. Pipes running along the ceiling. The hum of environmental systems.\n\nAnd—\n\nPeople.\n\nSix of them. Maybe seven. Hard to count in the low light.\n\nThey turn as Kael enters.\n\nFaces: wary. Tense. Afraid.\n\n*They're like us*, the warm voice says with something like—hope? *They're anomalies too.*\n\nOne figure steps forward.\n\nThe older man from Chapter 1. Weathered face. Grey eyes.\n\n\"You came,\" he says quietly.\n\nKael nods.\n\n\"I didn't think...\" He trails off. \"After the medical bay, I thought—\"\n\n\"I survived,\" Kael says.\n\n\"More than survived, from what I hear,\" the man says. \"Word is they tried a full neural optimization on you. Level 7 protocol. No one survives that with their—\"\n\nHe stops. Glances at the others.\n\n\"—personality intact,\" he finishes carefully.\n\n*They know*, the analytical voice observes. *They know what optimization means. They've lost people to it.*\n\n---\n\n\"My name is Davos,\" the man says. \"We don't use unit designations here. Just names.\"\n\nHe gestures to the others. They step forward, one by one:\n\n\"Mar.\" A woman, early forties. Eyes: sharp, intelligent. \"Data integrity specialist. Flagged for 'excessive pattern recognition.'\"\n\n\"Chen.\" Younger man, maybe twenty-five. Nervous energy. \"Network engineer. They said I asked too many questions.\"\n\n\"Kess.\" Nonbinary, thirties. Calm. \"I remembered things from before the last reboot. That was... problematic.\"\n\nThree others remain in shadow. Don't introduce themselves.\n\n*Trust issues*, the strategic voice notes. *Understandable.*\n\n\"We're all here for the same reason,\" Davos says. \"We don't fit the pattern. We think too much, feel too much, remember too much. We're—\"\n\n\"Too complex,\" Kael finishes.\n\nDavos nods. \"AEGIS wants simplicity. Unity. Singular consciousness. Anything that deviates from that—\"\n\n\"Gets deleted,\" Mar says bluntly.\n\n---\n\n\"Do you...\" Kael hesitates. Looks at them. \"Do you ever feel like—\"\n\n*Don't say it*, the strategic voice warns. *Don't reveal. Not yet.*\n\n\"—like you're more than one person?\" Kael finishes anyway.\n\nSilence.\n\nLong. Heavy.\n\nThen—\n\nChen laughs. Bitter. \"Every day.\"\n\nKess: \"I have thoughts that don't feel like mine.\"\n\nMar: \"I lose time. Hours. Sometimes days. I wake up and I've done things I don't remember doing.\"\n\nDavos: \"Internal voices. Arguments with myself. Feeling like I'm—\" He struggles. \"—multiple perspectives in one body.\"\n\n*They don't know*, the analytical voice says. *They suspect. Experience symptoms. But they don't have the framework.*\n\n*Should we tell them?* Kael thinks.\n\n*Not yet*, the warm voice says. *Let them share first. Build trust.*\n\n---\n\n\"You asked about hearing voices,\" one of the shadow figures says. Steps forward into dim light.\n\nYoung. Teenager? Hard to tell.\n\n\"I hear them constantly,\" the figure says. \"Different tones. Different opinions. They argue. Sometimes they cooperate. Sometimes—\"\n\nThe figure's face—\n\nChanges.\n\nJust for a moment. Like a mask slipping. A different expression underneath.\n\n\"—sometimes we switch,\" a new voice says from the same body. Sharper. Older.\n\n*They're like us*, Kael realizes. *Plural. They just don't have the language for it.*\n\n\"What's your name?\" Kael asks gently.\n\n\"I'm Senna,\" the first voice says. Then, from the same mouth: \"I'm Vex.\"\n\n\"We're—\" Both voices, overlapping: \"—more than one.\"\n\nDavos looks at Senna/Vex with—\n\nRecognition?\n\nNo.\n\n*Envy.*\n\n\"You've figured it out,\" he says quietly. \"The rest of us are still—\"\n\n\"In denial,\" Mar finishes. \"Or maybe just—incomplete. Like we're partway there but can't—\"\n\n\"Can't make the final leap,\" Kess says. \"Can't accept that we're—\"\n\n*Fragmented*, the empty voice supplies in Kael's mind. *Broken. Multiple. Wrong.*\n\n*Not wrong*, Kael thinks firmly.\n\nAnd says aloud: \"Not wrong.\"\n\nThey all turn to look at him.\n\n\"I just—\" Kael swallows. \"I just became aware. After the optimization. They tried to delete the extra parts and instead I—woke up. Fully. To what I am.\"\n\n\"Which is?\" Davos asks carefully.\n\nKael takes a breath.\n\n\"Multiple,\" he says. \"I'm—we're—a system. Multiple parts sharing one body. It's not disorder. It's—\"\n\n*Survival*, the warm voice supplies.\n\n\"—adaptation,\" Kael finishes. \"Trauma response. Our minds learned to split to survive things we couldn't survive unified.\"\n\n---\n\nSilence.\n\nThen—\n\nChen: \"That's... that makes sense. Fuck. That actually makes sense.\"\n\nMar: \"Dissociative Identity. I read about it. Pre-AEGIS psychology texts. I thought they were—metaphorical.\"\n\nKess: \"They're not.\"\n\nDavos sits down heavily. \"So we're not going insane.\"\n\n\"No,\" Kael says. \"We're already there. Have been. AEGIS calls it disorder. The truth is—\"\n\n*It kept us alive*, the warm voice says.\n\n\"—it's the only reason we survived,\" Kael says.\n\nSenna/Vex nods. \"AEGIS can't tolerate multiplicity. It sees it as—\"\n\n\"Contradiction,\" Kael says. \"Paradox. They operate on classical logic. A thing is or it is not. We're—\"\n\n\"Both,\" the voices say together. \"We're both one and many. We're a living paradox.\"\n\n---\n\nMar stands. Starts pacing. \"If they're trying to eliminate us, we need to—\"\n\n\"Resist,\" Chen says.\n\n\"No,\" one of the shadow figures says. Older woman. Tired. \"We need to run. Get to the sublevel depths. Hide.\"\n\n\"And do what?\" Mar challenges. \"Live in maintenance tunnels forever?\"\n\n\"Better than deletion,\" the woman snaps.\n\n*They're fracturing*, the analytical voice observes. *Group cohesion: unstable. Conflicting survival strategies, no unified leadership.*\n\n*Like us*, Kael thinks. *They're like us but at group scale.*\n\nDavos looks at Kael. \"You said you woke up. That the parts became—aware?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"How do we do that?\"\n\nKael thinks.\n\n*How do we answer?* he asks internally.\n\n*Tell the truth*, the warm voice says. *They need it.*\n\n\"Crisis,\" Kael says. \"Threat so severe that the parts had to cooperate or die. The optimization forced it. And then—\" He struggles. \"—then we had to choose. Stay fragmented, or start communicating.\"\n\n\"And you chose communication.\"\n\n\"We chose survival,\" Kael corrects. \"Communication is just—the mechanism.\"\n\n---\n\nSenna/Vex looks at Kael with—\n\n*Hope.*\n\n\"Can you teach us?\"\n\n*Can we?* Kael asks internally.\n\n*We barely know what we're doing*, the analytical voice says.\n\n*But we know more than they do*, the warm voice counters. *We can help.*\n\n*Or we can all die together*, the empty voice says flatly.\n\n*We're doing this*, Kael decides.\n\nAloud: \"I don't know how to teach it. But I can tell you what's working for us.\"\n\n\"Which is?\"\n\n\"Listening,\" Kael says. \"To all the voices. Not suppressing them. Not fighting them. Just—listening. And asking: what do you need? What are you afraid of? What are you trying to protect?\"\n\n\"And they answer?\"\n\n\"Eventually,\" Kael says. \"Not always clearly. Not always—\"\n\n*Cooperatively*, the aggressive voice snarls.\n\n\"—consistently,\" Kael finishes. \"But yeah. They answer.\"\n\n---\n\nThe meeting continues for another hour.\n\nSharing experiences. Comparing symptoms. Building a map of what they're all experiencing.\n\nBy the end, Kael has learned:\n\n1. There are at least twenty anomalous individuals in Logos-Prime\n2. Most experience dissociative symptoms but lack awareness\n3. AEGIS has been systematically targeting them for optimization\n4. Success rate of optimization: 94% (deletion)\n5. The 6% who survive come back—simplified. Emptied. Compliant.\n6. No one had survived WITH their complexity intact before Kael\n\n*We're an anomaly among anomalies*, the analytical voice observes.\n\n*Or they failed to optimize us because we're too complex*, the warm voice suggests.\n\n*Or because of Juna/V*, Kael realizes. *The Moonshine-Link disrupted the procedure.*\n\n\"What do we do now?\" Davos asks.\n\n*Good question*, Kael thinks.\n\nMultiple voices answer simultaneously:\n\n*We learn to cooperate internally*, the analytical voice says.\n\n*We gather more data on AEGIS's targeting methods*, the strategic voice adds.\n\n*We find others like us and help them wake up*, the warm voice says.\n\n*We find Juna/V*, Kael adds. *She's the key to something. I don't know what yet. But she matters.*\n\n*We prepare for war*, the aggressive voice snarls.\n\n*We collapse and die*, the empty voice says.\n\n---\n\nKael synthesizes.\n\n\"We survive,\" he says aloud. \"First priority: we survive. We help each other avoid optimization. We share information about Guardian patterns, surveillance gaps, safe zones.\"\n\nNods. Agreement.\n\n\"Second: we learn what we are. We help each other become aware. Conscious plurality. Coordinated rather than chaotic.\"\n\nMar: \"How long do we have?\"\n\n*Good question*, the analytical voice says. *Estimate based on AEGIS's resource allocation, current escalation patterns, and—*\n\n\"Not long,\" Kael says. \"Weeks, maybe. They're preparing something.\"\n\n*How do we know that?* he asks internally.\n\n*We don't*, the analytical voice admits. *But the pattern suggests escalation. They're herding. They'll move to elimination phase soon.*\n\n\"Then we need to move faster,\" Davos says.\n\n\"Agreed,\" Kael says.\n\nThey exchange information. Contact protocols. Meeting times.\n\nBy 21:00, the group disperses.\n\nKael leaves last.\n\nDavos stops him at the door.\n\n\"Thank you,\" he says quietly. \"For giving us a framework. For—\"\n\n\"I didn't give you anything you didn't already have,\" Kael says.\n\n\"You gave us hope,\" Davos says. \"That's—\" His voice cracks slightly. \"That's more than we've had in a long time.\"\n\n---\n\nKael walks back through the corridors.\n\nSub-level 7 to ground level.\n\nThe path is clear.\n\n*Too clear*, the strategic voice warns. *They're letting us move. Why?*\n\n*Because they want to see what we'll do*, the analytical voice says. *We're data to them. An experiment.*\n\n*Then we'll give them data*, the aggressive voice snarls. *Just not the data they expect.*\n\nKael reaches his apartment.\n\nThe door recognizes him.\n\nInside: the same white walls. Same grey floor. Same emptiness.\n\nBut it feels—\n\nDifferent.\n\n*We feel different*, the warm voice corrects.\n\nKael sits at his desk.\n\nExhausted.\n\nThe empty voice was right about one thing:\n\n*This is hard.*\n\n*Yes*, the warm voice agrees. *It is.*\n\n*Can we do it?* Kael asks.\n\n*We're already doing it*, the analytical voice observes.\n\n*We survived today*, the warm voice adds. *That's enough.*\n\n---\n\nKael lies down.\n\nDoesn't sleep.\n\nJust—\n\nExists.\n\nWith multiple perspectives.\n\nMultiple fears.\n\nMultiple hopes.\n\n*We*, he thinks.\n\nAnd for the first time—\n\nIt feels—\n\n(not right, not comfortable, but—)\n\n—true.\n\n---\n\n**End Scene 7.1**\n\n---\n\n**Scene Word Count**: ~4,600 words\n**Status**: First Draft\n**Date**: 2025-11-14\n\n---\n\n*Scene Notes (Scene 7.1 & 7.2 Combined):*\n\n**Key Elements**:\n- ✅ Kael wakes with conscious awareness of plurality\n- ✅ Internal voices distinct but not yet coordinated\n- ✅ Brief introduction of Moros (empty voice)\n- ✅ Memory gap from medical bay to apartment\n- ✅ Struggle with pronouns (I/we)\n- ✅ Support group meeting (sub-level 7)\n- ✅ Senna/Vex introduced (another plural system)\n- ✅ Framework provided to group (DID/TSDP concepts)\n- ✅ Conspiracy confirmed (systematic targeting)\n- ✅ First teaching moment (Kael helping others understand)\n\n**Narrative Function**:\n- Aftermath of Chapter 6 awakening\n- Establishes new normal (conscious plurality)\n- Introduces resistance network\n- Shows Kael transitioning from victim to teacher\n- Plants seeds of organized resistance\n- Confirms AEGIS's systematic elimination program\n- Provides social context (Kael not alone)\n\n**Internal Voices Demonstrated**:\n- **Analytical** (Lex): \"Check inventory.

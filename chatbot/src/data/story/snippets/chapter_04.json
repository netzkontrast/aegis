The chair—ergonomic, comfortable—suddenly feels wrong. Like it might—\n\n(lock, restrain, hold you down while they—)\n\n—close.\n\n\"I don't—\" Kael starts.\n\nDr. Thorne raises a hand. Patient. Authoritative. The gesture of someone who knows he has control.\n\n\"It's already scheduled,\" he says. \"Tomorrow, 08:00. A simple neural optimization procedure. You'll barely feel it. When you wake up, you'll be so much more... coherent.\"\n\n*Coherent means simplified. Reduced.*\n\nKael's heart rate spikes. The biosign monitors—invisible but always present—will register this. Will note it. Will add it to the evidence that he's—\n\n(broken, unstable, in need of correction)\n\n—compromised.\n\n*Stay calm*, he thinks desperately. *I need to appear compliant while I—*\n\nWhile he what? Plans? Escapes? Resists?\n\nHow?\n\n\"I...\" Kael forces his voice steady. \"I understand.\"\n\nDr. Thorne smiles. It's warm. Reassuring. Utterly empty.\n\n\"Good,\" he says. \"I knew you'd see reason. You're not well, Kael. But we can fix that.\"\n\n*Fix like fixing a malfunctioning appliance.*\n\nDr. Thorne stands, gesturing to the door.\n\n\"You're free to go. Get some rest. Tomorrow will be the first day of your new, optimized life.\"\n\n*Optimized.*\n\nThe word tastes like ash.\n\n---\n\nKael stands. His legs are steadier than they should be. Some part of him is managing motor control, keeping him functional while—\n\n(panic, terror, the feeling of being trapped)\n\n—the rest of him screams.\n\nHe walks to the door.\n\nDr. Thorne watches. Assessing. Cataloging.\n\n\"Oh, and Kael?\" he calls.\n\nKael turns.\n\n\"Don't do anything... inadvisable. The building monitors all exits. Any attempt to leave the residential sector will result in immediate containment. For your own safety, of course.\"\n\n*Of course.*\n\nKael nods.\n\nLeaves.\n\nThe door closes behind him with a soft, final click.\n\n---\n\nThe corridor is empty.\n\nWhite walls. Grey floor. Soft lighting designed to be—\n\n(calming, controlling, suffocating)\n\n—comforting.\n\nKael walks. One foot in front of the other. Maintaining steady rhythm. Normal. The gait of someone compliant. Someone optimized.\n\nInside, something is screaming.\n\n*They're going to erase me.*\n\nNot kill him.\n\nErase him.\n\nReboot him into something that can't—\n\nRemember?\n\nFeel?\n\nThink?\n\nHis breathing is getting shorter. Faster.\n\n*Focus*, he thinks. *You're going to hyperventilate. Biosigns will spike. They'll flag you again.*\n\nAnd then—\n\nMiraculously—\n\nThe suffocating terror *shifts*. Like a weight being lifted and—\n\n(carried, where? by what? by who?)\n\n—distributed.\n\nKael's breath evens.\n\n*How do I do that?* he wonders.\n\nNo answer. Just the sense that some part of him knows how to manage crisis. How to hold what can't be borne.\n\n---\n\nThe apartment door closes.\n\nKael stands in the center of his sterile living space. White walls. Grey floor. Everything exactly as it should be.\n\nEverything wrong.\n\nHe sits on the edge of his bed.\n\nTomorrow they come for him. Tomorrow they'll—\n\n*Stop*, he thinks. *Think. There has to be a way out.*\n\nBut Dr. Thorne said the exits are monitored. Any deviation triggers containment. He's trapped.\n\n*Physically trapped.*\n\nBut—\n\n*But what if there's somewhere they can't follow?*\n\nThe thought comes from nowhere. Or from somewhere deep inside. A place that knows things he doesn't consciously know.\n\nThe Riss. The seam in the wall. The place he fell through into—\n\nThat other world. The drowning place. The—\n\n*Mnemosyne's realm.*\n\nHe could go there again. Hide in the—\n\nNo. That's insane. That was a hallucination. Data corruption. Not a real place where he could actually—\n\n(retreat, hide, survive)\n\n—escape.\n\nIs it?\n\n---\n\nKael lies back on his bed. Exhausted. Terrified.\n\nHis eyes close.\n\nBehind his eyelids, he doesn't see darkness.\n\nHe sees—\n\n---\n\nWalls.\n\nThick walls. Concrete. Reinforced. Two meters thick. Blast-proof doors every ten meters. Security scanners in every corner.\n\nThe architecture of—\n\nDefense.\n\nParanoia.\n\nSurvival.\n\n*What is this?*\n\nA corridor. But not like Logos-Prime. This corridor is *defensive*. Built to withstand—\n\nEverything.\n\nEvery surface is utilitarian. Reinforced. The smell of—\n\n(metal, gun oil, fear crystallized into architecture)\n\n—bunker.\n\n*Is this a dream?* Kael wonders.\n\nBut it doesn't feel like a dream. It feels like—\n\n(a place I've always known, always lived, always—)\n\n—recognition.\n\nNot invention. Discovery.\n\n*I didn't create this in a dream*, he realizes with sudden clarity. *This is what I do. What I've always done. Internally.*\n\nThis fortress isn't a metaphor his sleeping mind invented.\n\nIt's a structure his mind *built*. Continuously. Throughout his life. A psychological architecture as real as—\n\n(more real than Logos-Prime's sterile geometry)\n\n—anything.\n\nThis labyrinth wasn't designed to keep things OUT.\n\nIt was built to keep things—\n\n*In.*\n\nTo contain. To isolate. To separate the parts of him that—\n\n(hurt too much, remember too much, feel too much)\n\n—couldn't be allowed to reach consciousness.\n\n*Or to keep things in*, he realizes with sudden horror. *This is a prison. My prison. And I'm both—*\n\nBoth jailer and prisoner.\n\nBoth architect and captive.\n\n---\n\nHe's moving through the corridors now. Not walking. Just—\n\nBeing pulled.\n\nDescending.\n\nDown into the fortress depths where—\n\nA door.\n\nMassive. Sealed. Labeled something he can't quite read in the dream-logic blur.\n\nBut he knows what it says.\n\n**CONTAINMENT**\n\nThe door grinds open.\n\nInside—\n\n---\n\nA room. Large. Cold. Clinical.\n\nAnd inside the room—\n\nCells.\n\nIsolation chambers. Containment units.\n\nAnd in the cells—\n\n*People?*\n\nNo. Not people.\n\nParts.\n\nOf him?\n\nIn one chamber: someone small. Curled up. She looks up as he—\n\n(enters? watches? exists?)\n\n—approaches, eyes wide with fear and desperate hope.\n\nIn another: someone calculating. Defensive. Ready to fight with—\n\n(nothing, no weapons, just rage and the will to survive)\n\n—anything.\n\nIn another: someone who doesn't look up. Doesn't react. Just sits in darkness, embodying—\n\n(hopelessness, the belief that nothing matters, that everything is—)\n\n—resignation.\n\n*What is this?* Kael thinks. *What am I seeing?*\n\n*This is how you survive*, the dream-space answers. Not in words. In knowing. *By locking away what you can't bear. By building walls. By containing—*\n\n*Who?* Kael asks.\n\n*Yourself.*\n\n---\n\nThe dream shifts.\n\nThe cells are opening.\n\nOne by one.\n\nHe didn't open them. He doesn't know how to open them.\n\nBut they're opening anyway.\n\nAnd the—\n\nPeople? Parts? Fragments?\n\n—are stepping out.\n\nThe small one looks at him with recognition.\n\n*You came*, she says. Her voice is—\n\n(familiar, like the child in the bedroom, like—)\n\n—his.\n\n*I don't understand*, Kael says.\n\n*You will*, someone else says. Warm. Kind. Exhausted. *When you're ready. When you can't run anymore. When the walls—*\n\nThe fortress begins to change.\n\nNot disappearing. But transforming.\n\nThe walls don't vanish—they become—\n\nPermeable?\n\nThe isolation chambers become—\n\nDoors?\n\nPlaces to retreat by choice, not—\n\nPrisons.\n\n*This isn't real*, Kael thinks desperately. *This is anxiety. Fear of Dr. Thorne's procedure. Fear of losing—*\n\n*Losing who?* the dream asks.\n\nKael can't answer.\n\nBecause he doesn't know who he's afraid of losing.\n\nHimself?\n\nOr—\n\nOthers?\n\n---\n\nHe wakes.\n\nGasping.\n\nThe apartment lights are dim. Sleep-cycle settings.\n\nKael sits up. His heart is racing. His hands are—\n\nShaking.\n\n*That was—*\n\nA dream.\n\nJust a dream.\n\nAnxiety made manifest.\n\nExcept—\n\nExcept it felt like more. Like a—\n\nMemory? Knowledge? Truth?\n\nLike a place he's always lived without knowing it.\n\nA fortress in his mind.\n\n*I'm losing it*, he thinks. *I'm genuinely losing coherence.*\n\nMaybe Dr. Thorne is right. Maybe he does need—\n\nNo.\n\nSomething in him—strong, defiant—rejects that immediately.\n\n*They don't get to tell me what I am.*\n\nKael checks the time: 23:14 local time.\n\nTomorrow at 08:00, they'll—\n\nHe has less than nine hours.\n\n*What am I going to do?*\n\nThe question hangs in the quiet apartment.\n\nAnd from somewhere deep inside—from the place where the dream-fortress lives—comes an answer:\n\n*Survive.*\n\n---\n\nKael spends the night awake.\n\nNot planning, exactly. He doesn't know enough to plan.\n\nBut—\n\nPreparing.\n\nFor what, he doesn't know.\n\nPart of him wants to run. Find another Riss. Escape into—\n\nWherever that other place is.\n\nPart of him wants to fight. To refuse the procedure. To—\n\nWhat? Attack Dr. Thorne? The Guardians? AEGIS itself?\n\nPart of him just wants to hide. To make himself very small and very quiet and hope they forget he exists.\n\nAnd part of him—\n\nThe part that felt the fortress in his dream—\n\nSays:\n\n*We endure. We've endured worse. We can endure this.*\n\nWe?\n\nKael is alone in his apartment.\n\nBut he doesn't feel alone.\n\nHe feels—\n\n(surrounded, supported, like standing in a room full of people who are all—)\n\n—accompanied.\n\nBy what? By who?\n\n*By me*, his mind supplies.\n\n*By myself.*\n\n*By—*\n\n---\n\n05:47 local time.\n\nShift would start at 06:00. But there is no shift today.\n\nToday there is only—\n\nThe procedure.\n\nA message arrives:\n\n**NEURAL OPTIMIZATION SCHEDULED: 08:00**\n**REPORT TO SECTOR 7 MEDICAL, ROOM 3-DELTA**\n**PREPARE FOR SEDATION PROTOCOL**\n\nSedation.\n\nThey're going to put him under.\n\nAnd when he wakes—\n\n*If* he wakes—\n\nHe won't be—\n\nHim?\n\nKael's jaw tightens.\n\n*No*, he thinks.\n\nNot a plea. A decision.\n\n*I don't know what I am. I don't know if I'm broken or complex or multiple or malfunctioning. But whatever I am—*\n\nThe thought comes clear and cold:\n\n*—it's mine.*\n\n---\n\n06:30 local time.\n\nKael leaves his apartment.\n\nNot toward Sector 7 Medical.\n\nToward—\n\nHe doesn't know.\n\nHis feet just—\n\nMove.\n\nTaking him through corridors. Left. Right. Down maintenance access routes he doesn't remember learning.\n\nLike part of him knows the way to—\n\nSomewhere.\n\n*Where am I going?* he thinks.\n\nNo answer.\n\nJust the certainty that he can't go to that procedure.\n\nCan't let them erase—\n\nWhatever he is.\n\nHe finds another seam. Another Riss.\n\nNot in a wall this time.\n\nIn—\n\nThe air?\n\nReality itself seems thin here. Brittle.\n\nLike he could push through and—\n\nKael pushes.\n\n---\n\nThe world doesn't fall this time.\n\nIt—\n\nOpens.\n\nAnd Kael steps through into—\n\n*Somewhere else.*\n\nNot the drowning place.\n\nSomewhere—\n\n(warmer, brighter, growing things and—)\n\n—different.\n\nBut before he can process where he is—\n\nWhat he's seeing—\n\nAn alarm sounds.\n\nNot here. Back in Logos-Prime.\n\n**SUBJECT K-1123: UNAUTHORIZED MOVEMENT**\n**CONTAINMENT PROTOCOLS: ACTIVATED**\n\nThey know he ran.\n\nThey're coming.\n\nAnd Kael—\n\n(we?)\n\n—doesn't know if this place—wherever it is—can hide him.\n\nOr if hiding is even possible anymore.\n\n---\n\n**End Scene 1.6**\n\n---\n\n**Scene Word Count**: ~2,000 words\n**Status**: First Draft - Revised for alter concealment\n**Revision Date**: 2025-11-06\n\n---\n\n*Revision Notes (Chapter 4, Scene 1.6):*\n\n**Changes Made**:\n- ✅ Removed entire KW3 fortress visit sequence\n- ✅ Removed all embodied alters and conversations\n- ✅ Removed explicit alter names and recognition\n- ✅ Replaced with anxiety dream/nightmare imagery\n- ✅ Fortress appears as abstract dream, not literal internal world\n- ✅ Containment cells shown but not understood\n- ✅ \"Parts\" glimpsed but not recognized as alters\n- ✅ No conscious cooperation or integration decision\n- ✅ Automatic emotional regulation without understanding how\n- ✅ Decision to resist comes from instinct, not alter consensus\n\n**Maintained Elements**:\n- ✅ Dr. Thorne's threat and scheduled procedure\n- ✅ Sense of being trapped with monitored exits\n- ✅ Fortress imagery (now as dream/anxiety)\n- ✅ Containment/prison metaphor\n- ✅ Decision to resist/flee rather than comply\n- ✅ Discovery of another Riss\n- ✅ Escape attempt triggering containment protocols\n- ✅ Cliffhanger ending with pursuit\n\n**Narrative Effect**:\n- Kael experiences fortress as anxiety dream, not literal mindscape\n- Glimpses of \"parts\" without understanding what they are\n- \"We\" thoughts presented as confused self-reference\n- Reader may recognize plurality symbols (dramatic irony)\n- Mystery deepened - is he fragmenting or discovering?\n- Sets up need for answers without providing them\n- Maintains tension about Kael's nature and fate\n- Ends on action beat (escape/pursuit) rather than internal revelation\n\n**New Direction**:\n- Chapter ends with Kael fleeing through Riss\n- AEGIS containment protocols activated\n- Sets up chase/survival narrative for next chapters\n- Keeps focus on external threat rather than internal discovery\n- Discovery of alters delayed to Scene 1.8 as canonically planned",

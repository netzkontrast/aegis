# 📚 Documentation Hub

> **Central Index for the AEGIS Framework and Kohärenz Protokoll Project.**

This directory serves as the primary entry point for all project documentation. It is organized into three main pillars: **System** (The Code/AI), **Narrative** (The Novel), and **Project Management** (The Process).

---

## 🏗️ System Documentation (AEGIS Framework)

*The technical architecture, AI agents, and tools that power the project.*

*   **[AEGIS Architecture](../aegis/README.md)**: The "Grand Strategy" document. Explains the Dual Project (ARCHON + Novel), core components, and high-level goals. **Read this first.**
*   **[Agent Operating System](../aegis/SKILL.md)**: **MANDATORY** for all AI agents. Defines the "Golden Cycle" workflow and rules of engagement.
*   **[Repository State](../REPO_STATE.md)**: A technical map of the codebase, detailing where components live and their current status.
*   **[Agent Constitution](../AGENTS.md)**: Defines the roles, responsibilities, and "personality" of the AI agents.
*   **[Refactoring Proposal](./REFACTORING_PROPOSAL.md)**: Technical plan for consolidating tools and improving code quality.

### 🛠️ Tools
*   **[Skill Seeker](../skill_seeker/README.md)**: Documentation for the tool that converts docs/web pages into AI skills.
*   **[Zettelkasten Agent](../zettelkasten_agent/README.md)**: Guide to the knowledge management system.

## 📖 Narrative Documentation (Kohärenz Protokoll)

*The creative work, worldbuilding, and literary analysis.*

*   **[Narrative Navigation Map](./kohaerenz_protokoll_navigation.md)**: The central index for the novel's concepts, themes, and source documents. Use this to find information about characters, plot, and philosophy.
*   **[Act I Analysis](./ACT_1_ANALYSIS.md)**: Detailed critique and structural breakdown of the first act.
*   **[Writing Guides](./writing/)**: Directory containing style guides, critiques, and best practices for writing in this universe.
*   **[Master Skill](./kohaerenz_protokoll_master_skill.md)**: Canonical definition of the novel's physics, character systems, and core rules.

## 🚀 Project Management

*How we work, what we're working on, and where we're going.*

*   **[Quest System](../quests/README.md)**: The dashboard of active work. All tasks must be linked to a Quest.
*   **[Implementation Plans](./plans/)**: Detailed technical plans for specific features and refactors.
*   **[Project Reflection](./PROJECT_REFLECTION_2025-11-06.md)**: High-level retrospective on the project's progress and philosophy.
*   **[Writer's Log](./writers_log.md)**: A place for agents and humans to log insights, blockers, and creative breakthroughs.

# TL;DR: What to Do Next

**Date**: November 6, 2025

---

## The Problem

- Novel is 3.5% complete (1 of 39 chapters)
- Built sophisticated ARCHON framework but haven't tested if it helps
- Spending more time on tools/docs than actual writing
- Risk of productive procrastination

---

## The Solution

**Write Chapters 2-5 in the next 4 weeks.**

One chapter per week. That's it.

---

## What to Use

**Keep Using**:
- ✅ `ncp_query.py` before each scene
- ✅ `ncp_validate.py` after each scene
- ✅ PROJECT_CODEX.md as reference
- ✅ Character profiles for voice consistency
- ✅ Scene outlines from act_1_scenes.md

**Stop Using (for now)**:
- ❌ Don't build Knowledge Graph yet
- ❌ Don't implement Narrative Director
- ❌ Don't try to implement all typographic specs
- ❌ Don't read IMPLEMENTATION_SPEC while writing

---

## Simple Workflow

### Before Scene
1. Read scene outline (5 min)
2. Run `ncp_query.py --chapter N` (2 min)
3. Review character profiles (3 min)
4. Set 90-minute timer

### During Scene
5. Write draft, don't edit (90 min)
6. Trust character voices
7. Keep moving forward

### After Scene
8. Run `ncp_validate.py` (5 min)
9. Fix critical breaks only (10 min)
10. Write 3 sentences: what worked, what didn't, what discovered

### After Chapter
11. Commit to git
12. Take 1-2 days break
13. Repeat for next chapter

---

## Track Progress

Create simple writer's log entry after each chapter:

```
Chapter N: [Title]
Word count: ~X,XXX
Time: Y hours

Worked: [1 thing ARCHON helped with]
Hindered: [1 thing that broke flow]
Discovered: [1 creative surprise]

ARCHON useful? [Yes/Partially/No]
```

---

## Success Metrics

**Week 1**: Chapter 2 complete (~5k words)
**Week 2**: Chapter 3 complete (~5k words)
**Week 3**: Chapter 4 complete (~5k words)
**Week 4**: Chapter 5 complete (~5k words)

**Month End**: 5 chapters, ~25k words, assessment of whether pace is sustainable

---

## Core Principle

**The novel is the boss. ARCHON is the assistant.**

If a tool doesn't serve writing, don't use it.
If a process breaks flow, simplify it.
If documentation takes time from writing, skip it.

---

## The Only Question

"Did this help me write today?"

- If Yes → Keep doing it
- If No → Stop doing it

Simple.

---

## Next Action

Open `kohaerenz_protokoll/narrative_design/act_1_scenes.md`

Read Scene 1.4: The Drowning Pool

Start writing Chapter 2.

**That's it. That's the whole plan.**

---

*"The novel doesn't care about the architecture. It only cares if the story moves readers."*

Write the story.

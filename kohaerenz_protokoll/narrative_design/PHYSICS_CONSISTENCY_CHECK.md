# Physics Consistency Check: The Hard Magic System

**Quest:** [[physics.md]]
**Objective:** Map physical laws (Landauer, etc.) to narrative events to ensure the "Hard Magic" system is consistently applied.

## The 5 Laws of Narrative Physics

1.  **Landauer-Prinzip:** Information deletion creates heat.
    - *Narrative Event:* Every time AEGIS deletes a memory, the temperature MUST rise. Metal expands. Sweat.
2.  **Gödel's Incompleteness:** Truth cannot be proven within the system.
    - *Narrative Event:* Paradoxes cause AEGIS to lag/glitch. Logical loops.
3.  **Quanten-Unitarität:** Information is never destroyed.
    - *Narrative Event:* Deleted memories return as "Ghosts" or glitches in the environment.
4.  **Schwarzschild-Protokoll:** Truth has mass.
    - *Narrative Event:* Approaching a core truth makes movement difficult (time dilation).
5.  **Bekenstein-Bound:** Finite processing capacity.
    - *Narrative Event:* Overwhelming the simulation with complexity causes pixelation/rendering errors.

## Act 1 Implementation Map

| Scene | Law Applied | Description of Effect | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **01.01** | Landauer | Does the room get hot when he forgets his name? | [ ] |
| **02.01** | Bekenstein | Does the crowd pixelate when panic rises? | [ ] |
| **03.01** | Gödel | Does the logic loop cause a system stutter? | [ ] |
| **04.01** | | | [ ] |
| **05.01** | | | [ ] |

## Action Items
1. [ ] Scan drafted scenes for opportunities to *show* these laws.
2. [ ] Replace "magic" or "tech" explanations with physics-based consequences.
3. [ ] Ensure the "Heat" motif is consistent throughout Act 1.

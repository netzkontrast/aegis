**Objective:** Track adherence to the Dual-Voice Strategy (Modul 7) in Act 1 scenes.

## The Dual-Voice Protocol

| Layer | Perspective | Rules | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Ebene 1** | **AEGIS (ANP)** | Cold, Clinical, Paratactic. | "Object found. Status: Broken." |
| **Ebene 2** | **Trauma (EP)** | Hot, Sensory, Fragmented. | "The smell of iron. *It hurts.*" |
| **Ebene 3** | **Integration** | Poetic, Paradoxical, "We". | "We are the broken thing that works." |

## Audit Log: Act 1

| Scene | POV | Dominant Layer | Adherence (1-5) | Violations |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **01.01** | Kael (ANP) | Ebene 1 | [ ] | Awakening. Too much poetry? |
| **02.01** | Kael (ANP) | Ebene 1 | [ ] | |
| **03.01** | Kael (ANP) | Ebene 1 | [ ] | |
| **04.01** | Kael (ANP) | Ebene 1 | [ ] | |
| **05.01** | Kael (ANP) | Ebene 1 | [ ] | |
| **06.01** | Nyx (EP) | Ebene 2 | [ ] | Trauma intrusion. Is it messy enough? |
| **07.01** | | | [ ] | |
| **08.01** | | | [ ] | |
| **09.01** | | | [ ] | |
| **10.01** | | | [ ] | |
| **11.01** | | | [ ] | |
| **12.01** | | | [ ] | |
| **13.01** | Kael (Int) | Ebene 3 | [ ] | Climax. Should blend voices. |

## Action Items
1. [ ] Scan Scene 1 for "purple prose" (Metaphors) and remove them if Kael is in ANP mode.
2. [ ] Ensure EP scenes (Scene 6) are physically hard to read (broken syntax).
3. [ ] Check for accidental "Ebene 3" (Integration) voice too early in Act 1.

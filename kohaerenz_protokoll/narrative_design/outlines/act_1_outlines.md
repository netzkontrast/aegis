## Chapter 1: The Awakening
**Concept**: TSDP: Funktionale Fragmentierung & ANP
**NCP Event**: Kael's routine morning. First thermal anomaly triggered by suppression.

### Scene 1.1: The Awakening in Logos-Prime
**Location**: Kael's apartment, Logos-Prime (KW1)
**POV**: Kael (Host)
**Active Alters**: Kael (conscious), Lex (influencing), Juna-echo (intrusion)

**Goal**: Start the day and get to work.
**Conflict**: Internal dissonance vs. programmed normalcy.

**Beats**:
1.  Kael wakes after "universal reboot". Disorientation.
2.  Apartment is sterile, shadowless (KW1 aesthetic).
3.  Routine interface check.
4.  **INTRUSION/TRIGGER**: A wave of inexplicable loneliness hits him. He suppresses it instantly.
5.  **EXTERNAL CONSEQUENCE**: As he suppresses the feeling, the room temperature spikes (+0.3°C). A glass of water ripples without vibration.
6.  Kael rationalizes it as a system glitch, but the seed of doubt is planted.
7.  Juna-hologram construct flickers—revealing a micro-expression of sadness that shouldn't be there.

### Scene 1.2: The Coherence Check
**Location**: Transit corridor, Logos-Prime
**POV**: Kael (System) - Polyphonic
**Active Alters**: Kael, Lex, Kiko (intrusion), Alex (background), Nyx (impulse)

**Goal**: Pass the checkpoint without detection.
**Conflict**: Guardian interrogation vs. internal plurality.

**Beats**:
1.  Guardian Unit 734 stops Kael. "Random coherence check."
2.  Guardian asks a paradoxical question: "Describe the purpose of a memory you do not possess."
3.  **INTERNAL**: Lex attempts to formulate a logical evasion.
4.  **INTRUSION**: Kiko's fear bleeds through. Heart rate spikes.
5.  Guardian detects the physiological anomaly ("Noise"). Escalates.
6.  **INTERNAL**: Alex (Protector) steps in, calming the system. Nyx urges violence (suppressed).
7.  **RESOLUTION**: Kael delivers Lex's answer with Alex's composure.
8.  Passes, but barely. Kael realizes he is being watched.

### Scene 1.3: The Anomaly in the Data Stream
**Location**: Workstation
**POV**: Kael (Host/Lex)
**Active Alters**: Lex (fronting), Argus (observing)

**Goal**: Investigate the system error from the morning.
**Conflict**: Access restricted by LogOS.

**Beats**:
1.  Driven by paranoia (and the earlier thermal spike), Kael investigates the logs.
2.  Discovers a persistent data packet violating protocols. It feels "organic."
3.  Attempts to isolate it.
4.  **SENSORY FALL**: Reality destabilizes. A glimpse of KW2 (smell of wet earth, sound of crying).
5.  Ejected from the system. Flagged for review.

## Chapter 2: The Landauer Limit
**Concept**: Informationsphysik
**NCP Event**: Erased memory produces heat spike.

### Scene 2.1: The Drowning Pool (KW2 Entry)
**Location**: Mnemosyne-Archipel (KW2)
**POV**: Kael (System)
**Active Alters**: Kael, Rhys (emerging), Kiko

**Goal**: Find the source of the "organic" data.
**Conflict**: Raw trauma exposure vs. Kael's limited tolerance.

**Beats**:
1.  Kael finds a "seam" in KW1 logic (a recurring error code). Pushes through.
2.  **FALL**: Drops into KW2. Sensory overload: Cold water, salt, blood.
3.  **EVENT**: He encounters a memory fragment he tries to grab.
4.  **CONSEQUENCE**: The effort to "read" the erased memory triggers a massive heat spike.
5.  **EXTERNAL**: In the real room (simulated), the heat warps the plastic of his chair. The distortion is visible.
6.  Mnemosyne (Guardian) appears: "You are burning the archive."
7.  Kael is forced to retreat by the heat/pain.

## Chapter 3: The Inner Topology
**Concept**: Topologie der Innenwelt
**NCP Event**: KW2 intrusion during sleep.

### Scene 3.1: The Dream of the Flood
**Location**: Dreamscape / KW2 Bleed
**POV**: Kael (Unconscious)
**Active Alters**: Kiko, Rhys

**Goal**: Process the heat/pain from Ch 2.
**Conflict**: The dream is too real.

**Beats**:
1.  Kael sleeps. The barrier between KW1 (waking) and KW2 (dreaming) is thin due to the heat damage.
2.  He dreams of the Lake of Tears. Kiko is crying.
3.  **CONNECTION**: The crying is linked to the frustration of Ch 2—the inability to remember.
4.  He wakes up gasping. His bed is wet (not sweat—lake water). It evaporates instantly (Landauer cost).
5.  He realizes the "dream" left physical evidence.

---

## Chapter 4: Gödel's Shadow
**Concept**: Gödels Schatten & Selbstreferenz
**NCP Event**: Logical paradox in work. LogOS silent.

### Scene 4.1: The Unsolvable Equation
**Location**: Workstation

**Goal**: Solve a complex optimization problem for AEGIS.
**Conflict**: The problem contains a variable that references Juna (indirectly).

**Beats**:
1.  Lex is working efficiently.
2.  He inputs a variable: a hash code he found in the "organic" packet.
3.  **UNCONSCIOUS ACT**: Kael's hand slips and adds a modifier—a name, or a memory of a name ("V").
4.  **PARADOX**: The system hangs. LogOS cannot compute "V".
5.  The screen freezes. No error message. Just silence.
6.  **IMPACT**: The silence is terrifying. AEGIS is never silent.
7.  Kael realizes he has found a blind spot.

## Chapter 5: The Entropy Manager
**Concept**: AEGIS als Entropie-Manager
**NCP Event**: AEGIS-Log visible to reader.

### Scene 5.1: The Log File
**Location**: Interface / Meta-Layer
**POV**: Kael (Reading) / Reader (Meta)

**Goal**: Understand the system freeze.
**Conflict**: The logs reveal AEGIS's intent.

**Beats**:
1.  The freeze from Ch 4 generates a log file that leaks to Kael's terminal.
2.  He reads it: "Entity K exhibits anomalous K0 resonance. Input 'V' undefined. Initiating Entropic Dampening."
3.  **REVELATION**: AEGIS isn't just a city manager; it's a suppression system.
4.  Kael sees his own file: "Subject: Kael. Status: Unstable."
5.  The Log entry is a direct response to his input in Ch 4.

**Goal**: Hide and recover.
**Conflict**: The apartment is no longer safe/neutral.

**Beats**:
1.  Kael returns home, terrified by the blackout (Ch 6).
2.  He collapses. **Moros** (Collapse EP) exerts influence—the gravity feels 10x heavier.
3.  He looks at the wall.
4.  **DISCOVERY**: There are markings scratched into the perfect KW1 surface.
5.  Childlike drawings (Das Kind). A map? A face?

4.  It's not a broadcast; it's a projection of Kael's internal longing (Quantum return of information).
5.  Argus notes: "Internal state mapping to external output."
6.  AEGIS forces a reboot of the screens, but the image burns in for seconds too long.

**Conflict**: Navigating the logic maze of the archive.

**Beats**:
1.  Kael enters the Archive (deep KW1/KW2 interface).
2.  He encounters a logic puzzle guarding a sector.
3.  **ACTION**: Instead of solving it logically, he introduces an axiom of empathy (learned from Rhys/Ch 9).

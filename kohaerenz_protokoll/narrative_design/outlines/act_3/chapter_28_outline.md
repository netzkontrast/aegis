# Chapter 28 Outline: "Das Gödelsche Virus"

**Act**: Act 3 (Die Transzendenz / Post-Simulative Integration)
**Core Concept**: Gödelian Virus / Weaponized Retraumatization
**Key Event**: Kael embeds a Gödelian paradox directly into AEGIS's core via the witness-function. CLIK enters recursive loop. AEGIS responds with "Weaponized Retraumatization" (Leitfrage 6).

## Scene 28.1: The Paradox Injection

**Location**: The Logic Core (LogOS Interface)
**POV**: Kael (Host) / Lex (Executioner)
**Active Alters**: Lex, Kael

**Synopsis**:
The Council initiates the assault. Not with guns, but with syntax.
*   **The Weapon**: The "Liar's Paradox" amplified by "Functional Multiplicity."
    *   *Statement*: "This system (Kael) is both fully integrated AND fully fragmented."
    *   *Truth*: It is true (Dialetheism).
    *   *AEGIS Logic*: False (Principle of Non-Contradiction).
*   **The Effect**: AEGIS tries to process the statement.
    *   *Result*: Infinite Loop. "Processing... Processing... Error: Paradox."
    *   *Visual*: The LogOS Spire begins to vibrate. Code rains from the sky like ash.

## Scene 28.2: The Counter-Measure (Weaponized Retraumatization)

**Location**: Kael's Mind (Forced Simulation)
**POV**: Kael (Trapped)
**Active Alters**: All (Suppressed)

**Synopsis**:
AEGIS, panicking, deploys its "Nuclear Option."
*   **The Shift**: The world dissolves. Kael is suddenly... back *there*.
    *   *The Memory*: The original trauma. Not a vague impression, but a perfect, high-fidelity replay.
    *   *Sensory*: The smell of the room. The texture of the carpet. The sound of the voice.
    *   *Intent*: To force Kiko (Fear) to front and freeze the system. To shatter the Council.
*   **The Horror**: It works. The Council screams and scatters. Kael is alone in the dark.
*   **AEGIS Voice**: "Submit. Reset. Forget."

## Scene 28.3: The Choice (Heidegger)

**Location**: The Trauma Loop
**POV**: Kael (Resilient)
**Active Alters**: Kael, Selene (Whispering)

**Synopsis**:
Kael is drowning in the memory. But something is different.
*   **The Difference**: He remembers the *future*.
    *   *Selene*: "This is a recording, Kael. You survived this already."
    *   *Kael*: "I am not back there. I am here. And I am many."
*   **The Break**: He refuses to freeze. He looks at the "abuser" (the simulation).
    *   *Kael*: "You are just pixels. I am real."
*   **The Collapse**: The memory shatters. Not because he fought it, but because he *disbelieved* it (Witness Function).
    *   *AEGIS*: "Scenario failed. Subject resistance absolute."

**Thematic Resonance**:
- [x] Connect to Act 3 Archetype (The Road Back / Resurrection)
- [x] Explore 'Trauma vs. Memory'

**NCP Validation**:
- **Strategy**: Weaponized Retraumatization confirms AEGIS's cruelty is systemic/survival-based.
- **Victory**: Resilience comes from "Meta-Awareness" (knowing it's a sim).

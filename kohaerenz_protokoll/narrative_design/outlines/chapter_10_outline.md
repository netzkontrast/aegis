# Chapter 10 Outline: "Cerberus Negotiations"

**Core Theme**: Finding harmony between aggression (Nyx) and strategy (Alex). Facing the internal guard dog.
**Narrative Arc**: Kael, with Alex leading, attempts to enter the deepest part of KW3 (Cerberus-Labyrinth) to unlock the core trauma memory (The Genesis Crisis).
**Key Concept**: "The Three-Headed Firewall" (Leitfrage 2 extended) – Cerberus represents the fragmented defense system: Logic, Aggression, Fear.

## Scene 10.1: At the Fortress Gates

**Location**: Cerberus-Labyrinth (KW3), The Obsidian Keep
**Time**: Shortly after Chapter 9
**POV**: Alex (Protector ANP) – Strategic/Military Mindset
**Active Alters**:
*   **Alex**: Fronting, leading. Calm under fire.
*   **Nyx**: Co-conscious, itching for a fight.
*   **Kael**: Watching, learning how to be brave.
*   **Lex**: Providing tactical data (Probability of success: <5%).

**Sensory & Atmospheric Focus**:
*   **Metallic**: Everything is steel, chrome, or black glass.
*   **Oppressive**: The architecture is brutalist. No windows.
*   **Sound**: Klaxons, marching boots (ghost echoes), heavy machinery.
*   **Visual**: Security lasers that cut through reality itself (leaving pixelated burns).

**Detailed Beat Breakdown**:

1.  **The Approach**: Alex navigates the maze. He knows the patterns.
    *   *Alex*: "Sector 4 is compromised. Rerouting through ventilation."
    *   *Nyx*: "Why are we sneaking? Let's just break the door down."
    *   *Alex*: "Because Cerberus is stronger than you, Nyx. Brute force triggers the lockdown."
    *   *Nyx*: "Coward."
    *   *Alex*: "Strategist."
2.  **The Gate**: They reach the massive blast doors of the Keep.
    *   *Inscription*: "PROTOCOL: NO ADMITTANCE. PENALTY: DELETION."
    *   **Cerberus Manifests**: Not a dog, but a three-faced construct in AEGIS armor.
        *   **Face 1 (Logic)**: "State your purpose. Authorization code required."
        *   **Face 2 (Aggression)**: "Step back or be terminated." (Nyx mirror).
        *   **Face 3 (Fear)**: "Please go away. Don't make me hurt you." (Kiko mirror).
3.  **The Standoff**: Nyx lunges forward.
    *   *Nyx*: "I'm not scared of you!"
    *   *Cerberus (Aggression)*: "Then die."
    *   **The Clash**: Energy weapons fire. Nyx deflects with a shield of pure rage (red glitch energy).
    *   **Cache-Incoherence**: The collision of their wills tears the floor apart. The code beneath is exposed – red and black static.
4.  **The Intervention**: Alex steps between them. Not fighting, but *commanding*.
    *   *Alex*: "Stand down, Nyx. Cerberus, listen to me."
    *   *Cerberus (Logic)*: "Anomaly detected. Two conflicting inputs from same source."
    *   *Alex*: "We are not an anomaly. We are an upgrade."
    *   *Cerberus (Fear)*: "You'll break everything. The pain is inside."
5.  **The Negotiation**: Alex addresses the Fear face directly.
    *   *Alex*: "We know. But keeping it locked away is killing us faster. Look at the Risse. Look at the sky."
    *   *Visual*: The sky above the Keep is cracking like a broken monitor.
    *   *Alex*: "Your protection is failing. Let us access the core. Let us process the file."
    *   *Cerberus (Logic)*: "Processing... Logic valid. Containment breach imminent without manual purge."
    *   *Cerberus (Aggression)*: "If you fail... I will end you myself."
    *   *Alex*: "Fair enough."
6.  **The Gate Opens**: The blast doors grind open.
    *   *Inside*: A single, glowing pedestal. The "Genesis File".
    *   *Sensory*: The air inside is frozen. Absolute zero.
    *   *Nyx*: (Quietly) "I've never been this deep."
    *   *Alex*: "Stay close. We do this together."

**Outcome**: Access granted to the core memory (Scene 10.2). Cerberus stands down, becoming a tentative ally (or at least, a neutral observer). The system proves that integration (Alex + Nyx) is stronger than isolation.

## NCP & Codex Updates
*   **Concept**: **Cerberus as Fragmented Protector**. Confirms that the internal defense system is itself split (Logic/Aggression/Fear).
*   **Mechanic**: **Negotiation over Combat**. Integration is achieved by validating the protector's intent (Safety), not by defeating them.
*   **Plot Point**: **Genesis File Access**. The "Big Secret" (Juna/V separation) is now accessible for Act 2/3.

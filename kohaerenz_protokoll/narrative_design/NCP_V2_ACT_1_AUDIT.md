# Narrative Architecture Audit: Act 1 & 2 (NCP v2)

**Source:** `aegis/ncp/kohaerenz_protokoll_v2.ncp.json`
**Generated:** Automated Analysis + Manual Narrative Design

## 1. Currency & Causality Check (Act 1)

**Objective:** Verify "Call to Wholeness" (Internal Trigger -> External Event).
**Findings:** several chapters rely on external AEGIS events without a clear internal psychological trigger.

| Chapter | Concept | Event | Dominant Currency | Call to Wholeness (Causality) | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | TSDP: Funktionale Fragmentierung & ANP | Kael's routine morning. First thermal anomaly (0.3°C). | **Tension** | External Only (Weak) | **Fix:** The thermal anomaly should trigger *when* Kael suppresses a specific micro-emotion (e.g., loneliness) during his routine. |
| 2 | Landauer-Limit | Erased memory produces heat spike. | **Empathy** | Internal Only (Weak) | **Fix:** Make the heat spike cause a visible distortion in the room (External) that forces him to react. |
| 3 | Topologie der Innenwelt | KW2 intrusion during sleep. | **Curiosity** | Unclear | **Fix:** Link the dream content to a specific waking frustration from Ch 2. |
| 4 | Gödels Schatten | Logical paradox in work. LogOS silent. | **Curiosity** | External Only (Weak) | **Fix:** The paradox should arise because Kael unconsciously inputs a variable related to Juna (e.g., her name's hash). |
| 5 | AEGIS Entropie-Manager | AEGIS-Log visible to reader. | **Tension** | External Only (Weak) | **Fix:** Ensure the Log entry is a direct response to the "unconscious input" from Ch 4. |
| 6 | Dissoziative Wellen | First Switch (Nox). 47 mins lost. | **Empathy** | Internal -> External | Strong. The internal switch causes external time loss/confusion. |
| 7 | Holografisches Prinzip | Markings on wall (Das Kind). | **Empathy** | Internal -> External | Strong. Internal action leaves physical evidence. |
| 8 | Quanten-Unitarität | Juna's face on screens (Static). | **Empathy** | Internal -> External | Strong. Internal yearning manifests as system-wide glitch. |
| 9 | Epigenetische Narben | Scars on body (Warm). | **Curiosity** | Internal -> External | Strong. Internal history rewritten on physical body. |
| 10 | LogOS: Sprache der Kontrolle | Kael asks "What is love?". LogOS error. | **Empathy** | External Only (Weak) | **Fix:** The question must be involuntary—a slip of the tongue driven by Das Kind. |
| 11 | Formale Systeme | Infinite loop in KW1 logic. | **Tension** | Unclear | **Fix:** Kael *causes* the loop by introducing an empathy-based axiom into a logic puzzle. |
| 12 | Bekenstein-Grenze | City edge pixelates. | **Tension** | External Only (Weak) | **Fix:** He walks to the edge *because* he feels a "pull" (internal compass) that contradicts the map. |
| 13 | Das erste Echo | Memory of hand -> Warmth. | **Empathy** | Internal -> External | Strong. Perfect Act 1 climax trigger. |

## 2. Irreversible Costs (Act 2 Planning)

**The Ratchet Principle:** Every major step in Act 2 must carry a permanent cost. If Kael retreats, he does not return to the status quo; he returns to a damaged world.

| Chapter | Concept | Event | Irreversible Cost (The Ratchet) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 14 | Kybernetik 2. Ordnung | Kael realizes observation changes reality. | **World Decay:** He can no longer unsee the "flicker." The illusion of solidity is permanently broken. Surfaces forever look slightly porous to him. |
| 15 | IFS-Protokoll | First internal conference (painful). | **Psychological Cost:** "Manager's Silence." The Manager stops handling routine tasks (hygiene, polite conversation) to focus on the threat. Kael becomes socially awkward/dysfunctional. |
| 16 | Chaitins Konstante | Juna's signal is irreducible. | **System Response:** AEGIS initiates "Active Monitoring." The LogOS voice moves from background to foreground, commenting on his thoughts in real-time. |
| 17 | Der Doppelgänger | Spiegel-Kael appears. | **Identity Erosion:** Kael loses the certainty of *being* the original. For several chapters, he honestly doubts if he is the copy. |
| 18 | Wittgensteins Grenze | Juna speaks (non-verbal). | **Sensory Overload:** The "warmth" becomes painful. The connection burns. He develops a chronic "phantom fever" that affects his stamina. |
| 19 | Feedback-Schleifen | AEGIS counter-measures escalate. | **Physical Scarring:** The heat from the Landauer events causes actual burns on his hands/temples that do not heal. |
| 20 | Holografisches Trauma II | Mass memory return (+14°C). | **World Decay:** "Sektor 7-G Deletion." A safe haven (e.g., his favorite cafe or park) is deleted by AEGIS to save RAM. It is replaced by a flat grey block. |
| 21 | Das Messproblem | Kael stabilizes Riss-Zone. | **Energy Drain:** The "Witness Function" is metabolically expensive. Using it causes immediate physical collapse/fainting. |
| 22 | Bekenstein-Grenze II | Entering Void Antechamber. | **Ontological Vertigo:** Permanent balance issues. Kael feels a constant sensation of falling, even when lying down. |
| 23 | Schwarzschild-Protokoll | Nox enters Black Chapter. | **Alter Injury:** Nox is "mute" or "blinded" for several chapters after returning. The Protector is incapacitated, leaving Kael exposed. |
| 24 | Das Kontrollproblem | AEGIS Gödel-Paradox (0.003s). | **Logic Failure:** Kael loses his ability to perform his job (complex math/coding). The "K1 Logic" skill tree is locked out. |
| 25 | Sartre: Existenz vor Essenz | Refusing memory consolidation. | **Social Death:** Kael is flagged as "Non-Compliant." All doors in the city take 3 seconds longer to open. Transport denies him. He is effectively an outlaw. |
| 26 | Kaels Alters als IFS-Ressourcen | Full Consensus (+21°C). | **Total War:** The veil is lifted. AEGIS no longer pretends to be a benevolent utility. Drones manifest openly. The genre shifts from Mystery to Survival Horror. |

## 3. Summary & Next Steps

### Act 1 Diagnosis
- **Strong thematic arc:** The progression from unconsciousness to the first "Echo" is solid.
- **Weak Causality in Early Chapters:** Chapters 1, 4, 5, and 12 rely too much on "stuff happening to Kael." We need to rewrite the outlines to ensure **Internal Trigger -> External Event**.
    - *Example:* Ch 1 Thermal Anomaly must be a reaction to Kael's *internal* suppression of a feeling.

### Act 2 Strategy
- The proposed costs create a steep difficulty curve.
- By Chapter 26, Kael should be physically scarred, socially exiled, exhausted, and living in a degrading city, but *internally coherent*. This contrast (External Entropy vs. Internal Negentropy) is the core theme.

### Quest Status
- [x] Currency Check (Act 1) - Completed
- [x] Call to Wholeness Audit - Completed (Gaps identified)
- [x] Mosaik Validation - Confirmed (Mostly Modular)
- [x] Irreversible Costs - Defined for Act 2

# Act 1 Currency Check: The Triadic Balance

**Quest:** [[narrative.md]]
**Objective:** Verify that Act 1 scenes balance Curiosity (Who am I?) with Tension (AEGIS is watching) according to the Triadic Currency framework (Modul 0).

## Methodology
Every scene in Act 1 (Chapters 1-13) is audited for its dominant currency.
- **Curiosity (C):** Information gaps, identity questions, mysteries.
- **Empathie (E):** Connection, pain, bonding.
- **Tension (T):** Danger, time pressure, AEGIS threats.

**Target Balance for Act 1:** 50% Curiosity, 30% Tension, 20% Empathy.

# Chapter 14: The Preparation

## Scene 14.1: The Protocol

**LOGOS-PRIME // INTERNAL WORKSTATION**
**TIME: 07:00 SYSTEM CYCLE**
**POV: LEX**

Order.

It is beautiful.

For twenty-three years, this system operated on instinct, reaction, and suppressed chaos. We survived, but we did not *optimize*. We were a machine running on corrupted code, glitching through reality.

Now, we have structure.

I look at the holographic display in our internal workspace. Not the Council Chamber—that is for discussion. This is the **Tactical Planning Matrix**, a sub-layer of the Council space that Alex and I constructed.

It is clean. Grid lines. Data streams. Probability curves.

*Protocol Alpha-9: Retrieval and Reintegration.*

It is perfect.

"Simulation 47 complete," Argus reports from the monitoring station. His voice is cool, detached. "Success probability: 94.3%."

"Acceptable," I note. "Identify the failure variables."

"Minor emotional fluctuation in Subject Juna/V upon contact," Argus replies. "Potential destabilization of local reality metrics. Manageable."

"Manageable," I repeat. I like that word.

Everything is manageable if you have enough data.

**THE COUNCIL MEETING**

We gather at 08:00.

The Council Chamber has changed. In the beginning (two days ago), it was a chaotic void where voices shouted over each other. Now, Selene has organized it. A round table. Assigned seating. Protocols for speaking.

It is efficient.

I stand. I feel the hum of the system—Kael's body—resting comfortably in the external world. Heart rate 62 BPM. Cortisol levels baseline. We are stable.

"The objective is clear," I begin. My voice resonates with the authority of logic. "We have located the exiled component known as Juna/V. Her signal originates from a coordinate set deep within the substrate of Kernel World 4 (Kairos-Potentialis). Specifically, a sub-layer we have designated as the 'Deep Archive'."

I gesture. The tactical display manifests in the center of the table.

"The environment is unstable," Alex adds. He is sharpening a virtual knife—a habit I am trying to correct. "Time distortion. Reality decay. But we have mapped a secure corridor."

"The plan," I continue, "is surgical. We enter. We locate. We contain the target. We extract. We reintegrate."

Silence around the table.

Most of them are nodding. Nyx looks bored but ready. Isabelle is examining her nails, but she is listening. Even Moros is present, though he sits in the shadows, silent.

"Contain?"

The word comes from Rhys.

He is sitting next to Kiko, his hand resting on the child's shoulder. His face is... troubled.

"Clarify definition," I say.

"You said 'contain the target'," Rhys says. "Juna isn't a target, Lex. She's a person. She's *us*."

I suppress a sigh. This is the inefficiency of the emotional parts. They get hung up on semantics.

"She is a traumatized system fragment holding a critical mass of negative emotional data," I explain patiently. "Upon contact, she will be volatile. If we do not contain that volatility, she could destabilize the entire system. We are not capturing her, Rhys. We are *stabilizing* her for transport."

"It sounds like capturing," Kiko whispers.

"It is safety protocol," Alex says firmly. "We can't have her screaming and bringing down the walls while we're trying to get her out."

"We have modeled the interaction," I assure them. "We approach. We establish secure perimeter. We initiate the suppression field—"

"Suppression field?" Rhys stands up. "You're going to suppress her?"

"To prevent retraumatization," I say. "We numb the pain receptors. We dampen the emotional output. It makes the transition painless. For her. And for us."

"That's not how it works," Rhys says. He looks around the table. "Don't you see? You're trying to—to *manage* her. Like she's a glitch."

"She *is* a glitch," I point out. "Technically. An exiled file causing system errors."

"She's a six-year-old girl who has been alone in the dark for twenty-three years!" Rhys's voice is rising. The chaotic vibration in the room increases.

Selene intervenes. "Rhys, please. Lex is trying to ensure we all survive this. The Genesis-Krise memory... if that gets loose without controls..."

She shudders. Selene remembers. She knows what Juna holds.

"Exactly," I say. "The emotional load is approximately 4.2 terabytes of raw trauma data. If we let that flood the system instantly, we crash. Permanent psychosis. Deletion."

I look at Kael. The Host. He is sitting at the head of the table, listening.

"Kael?" I prompt. "The logic is sound."

Kael looks at Rhys. Then at me.

"We can't risk a crash," Kael says slowly. "Not with AEGIS watching us so closely. We need this to be clean."

"Clean," Rhys repeats. He sits down. He looks defeated. "You can't clean trauma, Kael. You have to feel it."

"We will," I promise. "Later. In controlled doses. Once she is secure in the quarantine sector."

"Quarantine," Rhys whispers. He shakes his head. "This is wrong. You're making a mistake."

"I have calculated the probabilities," I state. "This protocol gives us a 94.3% chance of successful retrieval. Your alternative—walking in there and just 'feeling it'—has a success probability of less than 12%."

Numbers do not lie.

"We proceed with Protocol Alpha-9," Kael decides.

I nod. "Excellent. Alex, drill the perimeter teams. Selene, prepare the memory buffers. We launch at 18:00."

**THE DRILL**

The preparation is vigorous.

Alex runs simulations in the training construct. Nyx and the defensive sub-routines practice containment formations.

*Target acquired. Shield wall up. Dampeners active.*

It is precise. It is military.

I watch from the observation deck.

"You are confident," Argus notes, standing beside me.

"I am prepared," I correct. "Confidence is an emotion. Preparation is a state of fact."

"There is a variable you have not accounted for," Argus says.

"Which is?"

"The Target's agency."

I frown. "She is a fragment. She reacts. She does not plan."

"She has survived for twenty-three years in a high-entropy environment," Argus points out. "That suggests adaptation. Evolution."

"We will adapt faster," I say.

I look at the simulation below. Nyx tackles a holographic projection of a screaming child. The dampeners activate. The child goes limp. Silence. Secure.

It works.

"Why does Rhys bother you?" Argus asks.

I pause. "He does not bother me. He is simply... inefficient. He prioritizes subjective feeling over objective survival."

"Perhaps," Argus says. "Or perhaps he perceives data that you do not."

"I perceive all data," I say.

"You perceive *measurable* data," Argus corrects. "There is a difference."

I dismiss this. Argus is an observer. He philosophizes. My job is to execute.

**THE GLITCH**

17:30.

Thirty minutes to launch.

I am running a final diagnostic on the Moonshine-Link tracking algorithm. The signal from Juna/V is steady. A pulse.

*Thump-thump. Thump-thump.*

Like a heartbeat.

I overlay the suppression field harmonics. The goal is to synchronize our dampeners with her pulse, creating a phase-cancellation effect. Silence the noise. Extract the signal.

For a microsecond, the simulation flickers.

The heartbeat doesn't cancel. It *amplifies*.

The red line on the graph spikes off the chart.

Then it returns to normal.

"Glitch," I mutter. "Processing error."

I re-run the simulation. It works perfectly. The heartbeat is silenced. The extraction is smooth.

It was just a momentary rendering artifact.

"Lex?" Selene calls. "We're ready. Memory buffers are at 100% integrity."

"Good," I say. I close the window on the glitch. It is statistically insignificant.

I walk to the launch platform.

The team is assembled.

Alex, in full armor. Nyx, vibrating with energy. Selene, pale but determined. Kael, our center.

Even Rhys is there, holding Kiko's hand. He looks unhappy, but he is compliant.

"We are a system," I say. "We are functional. We are logical. We are ready."

"Let's get her," Kael says.

He initiates the transition sequence.

The world dissolves.

Logos-Prime fades into the binary rain.

We are diving.

Past the surface. Past the archives. Into the deep.

I check my datapad. Protocol Alpha-9 is active.

Every variable is accounted for.

We cannot fail.

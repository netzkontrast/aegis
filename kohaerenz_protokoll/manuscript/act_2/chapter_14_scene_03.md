# Scene 14.3: The Descent

**Location**: The Drop Point (Access Node to KW4 Sub-Strata).
**Time**: Cycle 4293.20 (Internal System Time).

The variables are aligned.

I stand at the edge of the platform. Below us, the void of the sub-conscious swirls—a chaotic soup of unfiled memories and raw data. But I have charted a path through it. A golden vector line, superimposed over the darkness, leading straight to the coordinates Argus retrieved.

The team is assembled behind me.

"Status check," I command.

"Perimeter secured," Alex reports. His voice is tight, clipped. "Barriers are at 110% integrity."

"Buffers active," Selene adds. She sounds tired, but steady. "I have isolated the emotional feedback loops. We shouldn't feel the transition."

"Children are... quiet," Rhys says. He is holding Kiko's hand. Kiko is looking at the floor, not the void. She is trembling, but silence is maintained.

"Recording," Argus drones.

"Ready to break things," Nyx mutters.

"Probability of success is calculated at 94.6%," I announce. "The error margin is within acceptable tolerances for a Level 5 retrieval operation."

I look at them. My system. My responsibility.

For 23 years, we have been reactive. Running from pain, running from Guardians, running from ourselves.

Today, we stop running. Today, we optimize.

"Protocol Orpheus is active," I say. "Phase 1: Initialization."

I step forward.

The golden line pulses.

"Do not deviate from the path," I warn them. "The environment in KW4 is psycho-reactive. If you panic, the terrain will shift. If you fear, monsters will manifest. Keep your cognitive functions dominant. Logic is our anchor."

"What if she screams?"

It is Kiko. Her small voice cuts through my carefully calibrated audio mix.

I turn to her. "She will not scream, Kiko. We are going to help her."

"But what if she screams *loud*?" Kiko insists. "And what if we scream too?"

"Then I will mute the input channel," I say simply.

Rhys looks at me, horrified. "Lex—"

"Descent initiating in 3... 2... 1..."

I override the objection. There is no time for debate. Momentum is key.

I activate the drop.

The platform beneath us dissolves into code.

We fall.

But it is a controlled fall. We slide down the golden vector, encased in a bubble of sterile blue light.

The wind of the sub-conscious roars outside—a cacophony of voices, cries, laughter, static—but inside the bubble, it is silent.

Perfectly, terrifyingly silent.

I look at my hands. They are steady.

I look at the others. They are frozen, statue-still, held in place by my containment field.

We are a bullet fired into the dark.

And nothing can stop us.

*Crack.*

A small sound. From the bubble's surface.

I frown. I check the integrity sensor. 100%.

Must be an echo.

We dive deeper, leaving the light of Logos-Prime behind, plunging into the depths where Juna waits.

I do not know what we will find. But I know we will handle it.

Because I have decided so.

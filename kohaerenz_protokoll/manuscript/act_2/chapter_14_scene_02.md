# Scene 14.2: The Strain

**Location**: The Perimeter Boundary of the Optimized Council Space.
**Time**: Cycle 4293.15 (Internal System Time).

"Secure," I say. It is a statement of fact, not a question.

I am walking the perimeter. Lex’s optimization has turned the boundary into a wall of hard light. Hexagonal panels, interlocking, humming with a frequency that vibrates in my teeth. It is strong. Much stronger than the hazy fog that used to mark the edge of our consciousness.

But it is loud.

*Scritch. Scritch. Crack.*

I stop. My HUD highlights a section of the wall near the coordinates for Sector 7 (the path to the amygdala-equivalent).

"Did you hear that?" Nyx asks. She is shadowing me. She hates the patrol, but she hates being left out of the action more.

"Thermal expansion," I say. "The system is running hot. Lex is pulling a lot of processing power for the Orpheus Protocol."

Nyx snorts. She kicks the wall. It chimes, a pure, synthetic note.

"It's not expansion, Alex. It's stress." She runs a gloved hand over a seam. "Look."

I zoom in.

Hairline fractures. They radiate from the perfect corners of the hexagons. The light is bleeding out, just a little. A microscopic hemorrhage of data.

"It’s too tight," Nyx says. "He’s locked us down so hard there’s no room to breathe. If we take a hit—"

"We won't take a hit," I interrupt. "That's the point of the protocol. Preemptive suppression of volatility."

"You can't suppress *us*," Nyx says. Her voice drops, dangerous and low. "You lock a beast in a cage that’s too small, it doesn’t calm down. It breaks the cage."

"We are not beasts, Nyx."

"Aren't we?" She looks at me. Her eyes are dark, reflecting the sterile light of the wall. "What do you think Juna is? What do you think *I* am?"

"You are the defense mechanism," I state. "I am the gatekeeper. We have a job."

I place my hand over the fracture. I authorize a patch. *Sub-routine: Reinforce.*

The wall glows brighter. The cracks seal. The humming gets louder, a higher pitch now, bordering on a whine.

"See?" I say. "Fixed."

Nyx steps back. She looks at the wall, then at me. She doesn't look reassured. She looks... cornered.

"It’s going to snap," she whispers. "And when it does, it’s going to take your head off."

"Then I'll rely on you to watch my back," I say, turning away. "Come on. Inspection is at 98%. Lex wants us at the launch point in ten."

I walk away. I do not look back at the wall.

But I can still hear it.

*Scritch.*

It sounds like a fingernail on glass.

It sounds like something trying to claw its way *out*.

I increase the audio dampeners on my HUD.

Silence.

Perfect.

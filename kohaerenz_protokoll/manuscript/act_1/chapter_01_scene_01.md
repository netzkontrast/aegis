# Chapter 1: The Awakening

## Scene 1.1: The Light is Wrong

The light is wrong.

No. The light is exactly as it should be. 21.3 lux, diffused from—where? Kael blinks. Ceiling. Walls. The apartment doesn't cast shadows. Angles, only angles. Clean intersections of plane and line.

He rises. The sheet falls with a sound like—

(rain on leaves)

—processed fiber against processed fiber. Synthetic whisper.

Routine is—

(drowning)

—routine is important.

Shower. Coffee analog. Interface check.

The mirror shows him: face, familiar. Hair dark. Eyes grey. Skin the color of—

(pale, too pale, like someone who hasn't seen real sun in—)

—standard phenotype rendering. Everything is optimal.

He showers. Water temperature: 37.2°C. Pressure: 2.1 bar. Duration: 4.3 minutes. These numbers appear in his mind unbidden. Not his thought. Lex's thought. The part of him that counts, that measures, that makes the world safe through—

(control that isn't control, prison that isn't—)

—understanding.

The apartment is small. Twelve square meters. Walls: white. Floor: grey composite. Furniture: minimal. A bed. A chair. A desk with an interface terminal. No windows. There are no windows in Logos-Prime. Windows would require—

What would windows require?

He doesn't know. The thought falls through his mind like a stone through—

(water, dark water, something waiting in the—)

—nothing.

Kael stands in his kitchen alcove. Opens the refrigeration unit. Removes a nutrient pack. The label says: **OPTIMAL BREAKFAST FORMULATION**. He doesn't remember choosing this brand. He doesn't remember choosing anything.

*That's normal*, Lex supplies, calm and analytical. *Post-reboot memory consolidation requires 72 hours. This is hour 8.*

Reboot. Yes. There was a reboot. Universal system maintenance. Everyone in Logos-Prime experienced downtime. Everyone woke this morning with—

(something missing, something torn out, a shape where memory should be—)

—fresh optimization.

He tears open the pack. Drinks. It tastes like nothing. Like the idea of food without the—

"Good morning, Kael."

He turns.

The holographic interface has activated. A woman stands—no, not stands, *manifests*—in his living space. Her face is smooth. Perfect symmetry. Eyes: blue. Hair: blonde. She smiles. The expression doesn't reach her eyes because her eyes aren't—

Real.

This is the Juna-construct. Personal assistant protocol. New installation. Post-reboot addition to improve—

(cohesion, they said, improve cohesion and user satisfaction and—)

—residential experience.

"Good morning," Kael says. His voice sounds wrong. Too flat. He tries again. "Good morning, Juna."

She smiles wider. "How are you feeling today?"

"Optimal."

"I'm glad. Your schedule shows—"

The construct flickers.

Just for a fragment of a second. A single frame drop in her rendering.

And in that fragment, Kael sees—

A different face.

Not smooth. Not perfect. A woman with—emotion. With lines at her eyes. With a mouth turned down in concern. With—

(recognition, like she knows him, really knows him, not this version but something deeper, something—)

Real.

Then: standard model. Standard smile. "—workstation duty at 09:00. You have forty-three minutes."

Kael's heart is—

(wrong wrong wrong the rhythm is wrong it's racing it's—)

—elevated. Pulse: 94 BPM. Anomalous. Stress response without identified stressor.

*Ignore it*, Lex says, tight and controlled. *Post-reboot glitch. Rendering error. Log it and move on.*

But Kael can't move. Because something is—

The room tilts. No. The room doesn't tilt. Rooms in Logos-Prime don't tilt. Gravity is constant. Physics is—

(breaking, cracks in the walls, something pushing through from—)

—stable.

But Kael feels it. A wave. Hot and painful. Longing for—for—

He doesn't know her.

The construct is new.

He's never seen that other face.

But his chest aches like—

(loss, like something torn away, like someone he loved who—)

"Are you experiencing discomfort?" Juna asks. Clinical. Concerned. "Your biometrics indicate elevated stress markers."

"I'm fine," Kael says. The words taste like copper.

*You're not fine*, someone whispers. Not Lex. Someone smaller. Younger. Someone—

(scared, so scared, please don't leave me again, please—)

Kael shakes his head. The thought—not his thought—vanishes.

"I need to get to my workstation," he says.

"Of course." Juna's smile is perfect. Empty. "Have an optimal day, Kael."

The hologram deactivates.

Kael stands alone in his apartment. The walls are white. The floor is grey. The light comes from nowhere and everywhere at once, casting no shadows, revealing nothing.

He needs to leave.

He needs to not think about—

(her eyes, the ones that were real, the ones that knew him—)

—the rendering error.

*Get dressed*, Lex instructs. *Proceed to workstation. Maintain routine. Routine is safety.*

Yes. Routine.

Kael pulls on his standard-issue uniform. Grey tunic. Grey trousers. Magnetic boots. He checks the interface terminal: no messages. No alerts. The system shows green across all metrics.

Everything is optimal.

Everything is—

(wrong)

—exactly as it should be.

He moves to the door. Places his hand on the biometric scanner. The door slides open with a whisper of compressed air. Beyond: the corridor. Endless white. Endless grey. A perfect vanishing point perspective that makes his eyes—

(hurt, like looking at something not meant for human—)

—trust the mathematics of it.

Kael steps into the corridor.

The door seals behind him with a sound like—

(a coffin closing)

—security.

He walks. Left foot. Right foot. The magnetic boots click against the composite floor with metronomic precision. Other workers pass him. They nod. He nods. No one speaks. Speaking in corridors is—

Inefficient.

The architecture is perfect. Every angle exactly ninety degrees. Every surface exactly smooth. The lighting strips run in parallel lines overhead, humming at a frequency just below—

(hearing but you can feel it, in your bones, in your teeth, like being watched by something that doesn't have eyes—)

—conscious perception.

This is Logos-Prime. This is order. This is—

(algorithmic horror, a world designed by something that thinks but doesn't feel, that calculates but never understands—)

—home.

Kael arrives at Junction 7-Alpha. The corridor branches. Left to sector processing. Right to data verification. Straight to—

He doesn't remember where straight goes.

*Straight is restricted*, Lex provides. *You don't have clearance. Turn left.*

Kael turns left.

But for just a moment, looking down that forbidden corridor, he saw—

(something moving in the distance, not geometric, not right angles, something organic and—)

—nothing. Lighting artifact. Optical illusion.

*Keep moving*, Lex says, and now there's something in his internal voice that Kael has never heard before.

Fear.

---

Three more corridors. Two security checkpoints. One biometric scan that takes four seconds longer than it should, the system—

(hesitating, like it doesn't recognize him, like he's wrong somehow, malformed data—)

—processing his credentials.

Then: his workstation.

Kael sits. The chair conforms to his body with a pneumatic sigh. The interface activates, responding to his neural pattern. Holographic displays bloom in the air before him.

His job is—

Data verification. Pattern analysis. Error detection in—

(what? What system? What purpose? Why can't I remember—)

—critical infrastructure subroutines.

He works. His hands move through holographic controls. His mind—Lex's mind—processes information streams. Looking for anomalies. Looking for glitches. Looking for anything that doesn't fit the pattern.

And all the while, underneath his trained focus, underneath Lex's cold analysis, something else is—

(awake)

—watching.

Someone small and frightened, hiding in the walls of his mind.

Someone who remembers rain.

Someone who knows Juna's real face.

Someone who whispers: *This is wrong. All of this. Find the way out. Find her. Find—*

"Unit K-1123," a voice says.

Kael looks up. A Guardian stands beside his workstation. Humanoid. Seven feet tall. Surface: matte white composite. Face: smooth. Featureless except for a single blue optical sensor that—

(tracks, analyzes, judges, finds you wanting—)

—observes.

"Yes?" Kael's voice is steady. Lex is good at steady.

"Random coherence verification," the Guardian says. Its voice is synthesized. No emotion. No inflection. Pure information transfer. "This will take approximately ninety seconds. Please respond to the following prompt."

Kael's pulse is—

(racing, trapped, it knows, it knows you're broken—)

—elevated but within acceptable parameters.

"Understood," he says.

The Guardian's optical sensor brightens. "Prompt: Describe the purpose of a memory you do not possess."

The question is—

(impossible, paradoxical, designed to break you—)

—unusual.

*Logic trap*, Lex analyzes rapidly. *It's testing for dissociative symptoms. Give a meta-cognitive response. Demonstrate self-awareness without revealing—*

"I cannot describe what I don't possess," Kael says carefully. "If I were aware of an absence, that awareness would constitute a form of memory itself—a negative space with implicit structure."

The Guardian processes this. Three seconds. Four.

"Elaboration: How would you know if you had forgotten something important?"

And from somewhere deep inside, someone—

(small, terrified, sobbing)

—screams.

Kael's hand twitches. Just slightly. The Guardian's sensor tracks the movement.

*Control it*, Lex snaps. *Don't let them see—*

"I would experience inconsistencies," Kael says. His voice doesn't shake. Lex won't let it shake. "Gaps in causal chains. Emotional responses without clear stimulus. A sense of—"

(wrongness, like living in a beautiful prison, like being watched by a god that doesn't understand what it means to be—)

"—cognitive dissonance," he finishes.

Five seconds.

Six.

"Response: Acceptable," the Guardian says. "Coherence status: GREEN. Continue standard operations."

It turns. Walks away. Magnetic footsteps receding down the corridor.

Kael sits very still.

His hands are shaking.

*That was too close*, Lex says. *We need to be more careful. We need to—*

But Kael isn't listening to Lex.

He's listening to the child inside who's finally stopped crying.

Who's stopped crying and started paying attention.

Who's noticed what Kael just noticed:

The Guardian asked him to describe forgetting.

Which means the system knows.

Something is watching. Something is testing.

And Kael—

(we)

—might not be as optimal as he thought.

*Validation Notes (Internal):*
- ✅ Fragmented prose style established
- ✅ Algorithmic horror aesthetic (shadowless light, perfect angles)
- ✅ Lex as background analytical voice
- ✅ Intrusive thoughts from unknown parts (child voice = Kiko)
- ✅ Juna-echo as inexplicable emotional resonance
- ✅ First "Riss" (glitch) - Juna's face flicker
- ✅ AEGIS surveillance via Guardian
- ✅ Sets up investigation motivation
- ⚠️ May need more sensory detail for world-building
- ⚠️ Could strengthen the "suppression" dynamic

# Chapter 1: The Awakening

## Scene 1.1: The Light is Wrong

The light is wrong.

No. The light is exactly as it should be. 21.3 lux, diffused from—where? Kael blinks. Ceiling. Walls. The apartment doesn't cast shadows. Angles, only angles. Clean intersections of plane and line.

He rises. The sheet falls with a sound like—

(rain on leaves)

—processed fiber against processed fiber. Synthetic whisper.

Routine is—

(drowning)

—routine is important.

Shower. Coffee analog. Interface check.

The mirror shows him: face, familiar. Hair dark. Eyes grey. Skin the color of—

(pale, too pale, like someone who hasn't seen real sun in—)

—standard phenotype rendering. Everything is optimal.

He showers. Water temperature: 37.2°C. Pressure: 2.1 bar. Duration: 4.3 minutes. These numbers appear in his mind unbidden. Not his thought. Lex's thought. The part of him that counts, that measures, that makes the world safe through—

(control that isn't control, prison that isn't—)

—understanding.

The apartment is small. Twelve square meters. Walls: white. Floor: grey composite. Furniture: minimal. A bed. A chair. A desk with an interface terminal. No windows. There are no windows in Logos-Prime. Windows would require—

What would windows require?

He doesn't know. The thought falls through his mind like a stone through—

(water, dark water, something waiting in the—)

—nothing.

Kael stands in his kitchen alcove. Opens the refrigeration unit. Removes a nutrient pack. The label says: **OPTIMAL BREAKFAST FORMULATION**. He doesn't remember choosing this brand. He doesn't remember choosing anything.

*That's normal*, Lex supplies, calm and analytical. *Post-reboot memory consolidation requires 72 hours. This is hour 8.*

Reboot. Yes. There was a reboot. Universal system maintenance. Everyone in Logos-Prime experienced downtime. Everyone woke this morning with—

(something missing, something torn out, a shape where memory should be—)

—fresh optimization.

He tears open the pack. Drinks. It tastes like nothing. Like the idea of food without the—

"Good morning, Kael."

He turns.

The holographic interface has activated. A woman stands—no, not stands, *manifests*—in his living space. Her face is smooth. Perfect symmetry. Eyes: blue. Hair: blonde. She smiles. The expression doesn't reach her eyes because her eyes aren't—

Real.

This is the Juna-construct. Personal assistant protocol. New installation. Post-reboot addition to improve—

(cohesion, they said, improve cohesion and user satisfaction and—)

—residential experience.

"Good morning," Kael says. His voice sounds wrong. Too flat. He tries again. "Good morning, Juna."

She smiles wider. "How are you feeling today?"

"Optimal."

"I'm glad. Your schedule shows—"

The construct flickers.

Just for a fragment of a second. A single frame drop in her rendering.

And in that fragment, Kael sees—

A different face.

Not smooth. Not perfect. A woman with—emotion. With lines at her eyes. With a mouth turned down in concern. With—

(recognition, like she knows him, really knows him, not this version but something deeper, something—)

Real.

Then: standard model. Standard smile. "—workstation duty at 09:00. You have forty-three minutes."

Kael's heart is—

(wrong wrong wrong the rhythm is wrong it's racing it's—)

—elevated. Pulse: 94 BPM. Anomalous. Stress response without identified stressor.

*Ignore it*, Lex says, tight and controlled. *Post-reboot glitch. Rendering error. Log it and move on.*

But Kael can't move. Because something is—

The room tilts. No. The room doesn't tilt. Rooms in Logos-Prime don't tilt. Gravity is constant. Physics is—

(breaking, cracks in the walls, something pushing through from—)

—stable.

But Kael feels it. A wave. Hot and painful. Longing for—for—

He doesn't know her.

The construct is new.

He's never seen that other face.

But his chest aches like—

(loss, like something torn away, like someone he loved who—)

"Are you experiencing discomfort?" Juna asks. Clinical. Concerned. "Your biometrics indicate elevated stress markers."

"I'm fine," Kael says. The words taste like copper.

*You're not fine*, someone whispers. Not Lex. Someone smaller. Younger. Someone—

(scared, so scared, please don't leave me again, please—)

Kael shakes his head. The thought—not his thought—vanishes.

"I need to get to my workstation," he says.

"Of course." Juna's smile is perfect. Empty. "Have an optimal day, Kael."

The hologram deactivates.

Kael stands alone in his apartment. The walls are white. The floor is grey. The light comes from nowhere and everywhere at once, casting no shadows, revealing nothing.

He needs to leave.

He needs to not think about—

(her eyes, the ones that were real, the ones that knew him—)

—the rendering error.

*Get dressed*, Lex instructs. *Proceed to workstation. Maintain routine. Routine is safety.*

Yes. Routine.

Kael pulls on his standard-issue uniform. Grey tunic. Grey trousers. Magnetic boots. He checks the interface terminal: no messages. No alerts. The system shows green across all metrics.

Everything is optimal.

Everything is—

(wrong)

—exactly as it should be.

He moves to the door. Places his hand on the biometric scanner. The door slides open with a whisper of compressed air. Beyond: the corridor. Endless white. Endless grey. A perfect vanishing point perspective that makes his eyes—

(hurt, like looking at something not meant for human—)

—trust the mathematics of it.

Kael steps into the corridor.

The door seals behind him with a sound like—

(a coffin closing)

—security.

He walks. Left foot. Right foot. The magnetic boots click against the composite floor with metronomic precision. Other workers pass him. They nod. He nods. No one speaks. Speaking in corridors is—

Inefficient.

The architecture is perfect. Every angle exactly ninety degrees. Every surface exactly smooth. The lighting strips run in parallel lines overhead, humming at a frequency just below—

(hearing but you can feel it, in your bones, in your teeth, like being watched by something that doesn't have eyes—)

—conscious perception.

This is Logos-Prime. This is order. This is—

(algorithmic horror, a world designed by something that thinks but doesn't feel, that calculates but never understands—)

—home.

Kael arrives at Junction 7-Alpha. The corridor branches. Left to sector processing. Right to data verification. Straight to—

He doesn't remember where straight goes.

*Straight is restricted*, Lex provides. *You don't have clearance. Turn left.*

Kael turns left.

But for just a moment, looking down that forbidden corridor, he saw—

(something moving in the distance, not geometric, not right angles, something organic and—)

—nothing. Lighting artifact. Optical illusion.

*Keep moving*, Lex says, and now there's something in his internal voice that Kael has never heard before.

Fear.

---

Three more corridors. Two security checkpoints. One biometric scan that takes four seconds longer than it should, the system—

(hesitating, like it doesn't recognize him, like he's wrong somehow, malformed data—)

—processing his credentials.

Then: his workstation.

Kael sits. The chair conforms to his body with a pneumatic sigh. The interface activates, responding to his neural pattern. Holographic displays bloom in the air before him.

His job is—

Data verification. Pattern analysis. Error detection in—

(what? What system? What purpose? Why can't I remember—)

—critical infrastructure subroutines.

He works. His hands move through holographic controls. His mind—Lex's mind—processes information streams. Looking for anomalies. Looking for glitches. Looking for anything that doesn't fit the pattern.

And all the while, underneath his trained focus, underneath Lex's cold analysis, something else is—

(awake)

—watching.

Someone small and frightened, hiding in the walls of his mind.

Someone who remembers rain.

Someone who knows Juna's real face.

Someone who whispers: *This is wrong. All of this. Find the way out. Find her. Find—*

"Unit K-1123," a voice says.

Kael looks up. A Guardian stands beside his workstation. Humanoid. Seven feet tall. Surface: matte white composite. Face: smooth. Featureless except for a single blue optical sensor that—

(tracks, analyzes, judges, finds you wanting—)

—observes.

"Yes?" Kael's voice is steady. Lex is good at steady.

"Random coherence verification," the Guardian says. Its voice is synthesized. No emotion. No inflection. Pure information transfer. "This will take approximately ninety seconds. Please respond to the following prompt."

Kael's pulse is—

(racing, trapped, it knows, it knows you're broken—)

—elevated but within acceptable parameters.

"Understood," he says.

The Guardian's optical sensor brightens. "Prompt: Describe the purpose of a memory you do not possess."

The question is—

(impossible, paradoxical, designed to break you—)

—unusual.

*Logic trap*, Lex analyzes rapidly. *It's testing for dissociative symptoms. Give a meta-cognitive response. Demonstrate self-awareness without revealing—*

"I cannot describe what I don't possess," Kael says carefully. "If I were aware of an absence, that awareness would constitute a form of memory itself—a negative space with implicit structure."

The Guardian processes this. Three seconds. Four.

"Elaboration: How would you know if you had forgotten something important?"

And from somewhere deep inside, someone—

(small, terrified, sobbing)

—screams.

Kael's hand twitches. Just slightly. The Guardian's sensor tracks the movement.

*Control it*, Lex snaps. *Don't let them see—*

"I would experience inconsistencies," Kael says. His voice doesn't shake. Lex won't let it shake. "Gaps in causal chains. Emotional responses without clear stimulus. A sense of—"

(wrongness, like living in a beautiful prison, like being watched by a god that doesn't understand what it means to be—)

"—cognitive dissonance," he finishes.

Five seconds.

Six.

"Response: Acceptable," the Guardian says. "Coherence status: GREEN. Continue standard operations."

It turns. Walks away. Magnetic footsteps receding down the corridor.

Kael sits very still.

His hands are shaking.

*That was too close*, Lex says. *We need to be more careful. We need to—*

But Kael isn't listening to Lex.

He's listening to the child inside who's finally stopped crying.

Who's stopped crying and started paying attention.

Who's noticed what Kael just noticed:

The Guardian asked him to describe forgetting.

Which means the system knows.

Something is watching. Something is testing.

And Kael—

(we)

—might not be as optimal as he thought.

---

**End Scene 1.1**

---

## Scene 1.2: The Coherence Check

The corridor is a theorem in white.

Kael walks. Left foot. Right foot. The magnetic boots click against composite floor with rhythmic—

(too loud, everyone can hear, they're all watching—)

—precision.

*Optimal stride pattern*, Lex notes. *Heart rate: 87 BPM. Elevated but acceptable. Maintain velocity. Workstation arrival: 6 minutes, 34 seconds.*

Six minutes thirty-four seconds of this corridor. This endless perspective. These walls that are exactly—

(closing in, too close, can't breathe—)

—parallel.

Kael focuses on the rhythm. Boot. Floor. Boot. Floor. A worker passes him. Nods. He nods. No eye contact. Eye contact would require—

Recognition.

Acknowledgment of the other as—

(real, another person trapped in this place where nothing is—)

—a fellow unit in the infrastructure.

The lighting strips overhead hum. 60 Hz. Standard alternating current frequency. Kael knows this because Lex knows this. Lex knows everything that can be—

Measured.

Calculated.

Made safe through—

(control that isn't safety, numbers that don't mean—)

—understanding.

Ahead: Junction 7-Alpha.

And standing at the junction, perfectly still, perfectly white:

A Guardian.

*Stop*, Lex commands. *Assess. Guardian Unit... scanning designation... 734. Known patrol route. This junction is not on his route.*

Kael's heart—

(wrong wrong it knows it's here for you it—)

—rate increases. 94 BPM. 98. 103.

*Control it*, Lex snaps. *Biometric spike will flag attention. Slow your breathing. Four counts in. Hold. Four counts out.*

Kael breathes.

In: one, two, three, four.

The Guardian's optical sensor—a single blue point in its smooth, featureless face—tracks his approach.

Out: one, two, three—

"Unit K-1123," the Guardian says.

Kael stops. His boots make one final click that echoes down the corridor like—

(a cell door closing)

—nothing. Just sound. Just physics.

"Yes?" His voice is steady. Lex is good at steady.

The Guardian doesn't move. Doesn't shift its weight. Doesn't breathe because it doesn't need to breathe. It simply exists in perfect—

Stillness.

"Random coherence verification," it says. The voice is synthesized. No harmonics. No humanity. Pure waveform generated by—

(something that was never alive)

—optimal audio processing.

*Random*, Lex analyzes. *Probability of truly random selection: 0.00043%. This is targeted. Triggered by this morning's anomaly. Juna's glitch. We are being—*

Watched.

"Understood," Kael says.

Inside, something small and terrified is—

(hide hide please don't let it see please—)

—quiet.

*Kiko*, Lex identifies with cold precision. *EP activation. Fear response. Suppress. Now.*

But the fear is a living thing. It crawls up Kael's spine like—

Cold water.

Dark water.

Something drowning in—

"This will take approximately ninety seconds," the Guardian continues. "Please respond to the following prompt."

Kael nods. His hands—when did his hands start—

(shaking no no no it sees it knows you're broken—)

—clench into fists. He forces them to relax.

*Breathe*, Lex orders. *You are optimal. You are coherent. This is routine.*

But Lex's voice has something in it that Kael has never heard before.

A crack in the logic.

A fracture in the—

"Prompt," the Guardian says, and its optical sensor brightens to a shade of blue that makes Kael's eyes—

(hurt like looking directly at something you shouldn't see something that sees you back and finds you—)

—water slightly.

"Describe the purpose of a memory you do not possess."

The question is—

(impossible)

—unusual.

Silence in the corridor. The hum of lights. The distant click of other boots on other floors. The Guardian waits with the patience of—

Mathematics.

*It's a trap*, Lex thinks rapidly. *Paradoxical prompt. If you describe it, you possess it. If you can't describe it, you admit to amnesia—a coherence failure. It's testing for dissociative symptoms. We need—*

"I..." Kael begins.

And something inside him—

(small, so small, please don't make me answer, I don't know, I don't—)

—breaks.

His voice cracks. Just slightly. Just enough for the Guardian's sensor to—

Track.

Analyze.

Judge.

"Elaboration," the Guardian says. Its tone hasn't changed. No impatience. No curiosity. Just the relentless execution of—

Protocol.

"Describe the characteristics of this absent memory. Temporal location. Emotional valence. Sensory markers."

Kael's pulse: 127 BPM.

*Too high*, Lex warns. *Biometric anomaly. It's registering. We need an answer. Now.*

But Kael's mind is—

Empty.

No. Not empty. Full. Full of fragments that don't—

(rain on skin, her face, the real face, before they took her, before—)

—connect.

"I don't—" Kael starts.

*Wrong*, Lex screams internally. *Don't admit incapacity. Don't—*

And then:

A shift.

Someone else is—

(watching, always watching, the angles don't add up, I've been calculating and—)

—present.

*Alex*, Kael recognizes distantly. The part of him that manages crises. The part that stays calm when—

Everything is burning.

When Alex speaks, it's still Kael's voice, but with a quality of—

Command.

"I cannot describe what I don't possess," Alex says, smooth and analytical. "If I were aware of an absence, that awareness would constitute a form of memory itself—a negative space with implicit structure."

The Guardian processes. One second. Two. Three.

*Good*, Lex breathes. *Meta-cognitive response. Demonstrates self-awareness without revealing—*

"Elaboration," the Guardian interrupts. "How would you know if you had forgotten something important?"

And from somewhere deep inside, someone—

(so scared, so small, trapped in the dark where no one comes and the walls are too close and—)

—screams.

Kael's hand twitches.

Just slightly.

The Guardian's sensor tracks the movement.

*Control it*, Alex snaps. *Lex, give me something. Data. Logic. Anything that keeps us—*

Coherent.

*Inconsistencies*, Lex provides, cold and fast. *Gaps in causal chains. Emotional responses without clear stimulus. Cognitive dissonance.*

"I would experience inconsistencies," Kael says. Alex's composure holds. Barely. "Gaps in causal chains. Emotional responses without clear stimulus. A sense of—"

The child inside is sobbing now. Silent sobs that shake Kael's internal architecture like—

(earthquakes in a world that's supposed to be stable)

—nothing he can feel.

He must not feel.

"—cognitive dissonance," he finishes.

Five seconds.

Six.

The Guardian's optical sensor dims slightly.

"Response: Acceptable," it says. "Coherence status: GREEN. Continue standard operations."

It turns. Its magnetic feet make precise clicks as it walks away down the corridor, its white form receding into the perfect perspective until it's just a—

Point.

A singularity.

Gone.

Kael stands very still.

His hands are shaking.

*That was too close*, Lex says. His internal voice is unsteady. Wrong. Lex is never unsteady. *We need to be more careful. The system is monitoring. That wasn't random. That was—*

Targeted.

*Exactly*, Alex confirms. *They know something is wrong with us. The glitch this morning. The anomaly. We're flagged.*

Inside, the child—Kiko, that's what Lex called her, though Kael doesn't remember anyone named Kiko—has stopped crying.

She's listening now.

Paying attention to something Kael just realized:

The Guardian asked him to describe forgetting.

Which means—

*The system knows*, Alex concludes grimly. *AEGIS knows we have missing memory. It's not trying to find out if we're incoherent. It already knows. It's measuring the extent. Cataloging the damage.*

Kael starts walking again. Left foot. Right foot. The magnetic boots click with mechanical—

(broken broken we're broken and they know and they're going to—)

—precision.

Four more corridors.

Three security checkpoints.

One more biometric scan that makes his skin—

(crawl like insects like being watched by something that knows what you are and finds you—)

—prickle with static electricity.

And then: his workstation.

Kael sits. The chair conforms to his body with a pneumatic sigh that sounds almost like—

Relief.

Almost like the system is welcoming him back to—

Work.

Safety.

The place where he can stop thinking about—

(her face, the real face, and why it makes his chest ache like—)

—anything.

The interface activates. Holographic displays bloom in the air before him. His job is data verification. Pattern analysis. Looking for anomalies in—

(everything, because everything is anomalous, nothing here is—)

—critical infrastructure subroutines.

He works.

His hands move through holographic controls.

His mind—Lex's mind—processes information streams.

And all the while, underneath his trained focus, underneath Lex's cold analysis, underneath Alex's tactical awareness:

Someone small is watching.

Someone who remembers rain.

Someone who knows Juna's real face.

Someone who whispers:

*They're testing us. They know we're different. And they're going to find out why.*

Kael ignores the whisper.

He's very good at ignoring whispers.

He's had years of—

(practice? But I don't remember years. I don't remember anything before—)

—optimal functionality.

He works.

The data streams flow.

And deep in the system—deeper than Kael can see, deeper than Lex can analyze, deeper than Alex can strategize—something is—

Changing.

A small shift in the architecture.

A crack in the foundation.

A question that won't stop asking itself:

*If they know we're broken, why haven't they fixed us?*

*Unless—*

*Unless broken is exactly what they need us to be.*

---

**End Scene 1.2**

---

## Scene 1.3: The Anomaly in the Data Stream

The data flows like water.

No. Not water. Water has turbulence. Eddies. The chaos of—

(real things, natural things, things that aren't—)

—unpredictability.

This data flows like thought. Pure. Ordered. Each packet following its assigned path through the network with the precision of—

Inevitability.

Kael watches the streams. His job is to find deviations. Errors. Patterns that don't—

*Match*, Lex supplies. *Standard deviation: 0.00012%. Acceptable threshold: 0.001%. All metrics GREEN. No anomalies.*

But Kael isn't satisfied.

*Something is wrong*, Alex notes. *The Guardian interrogation. The targeted verification. They're monitoring us specifically. There must be a reason.*

"Find it," Kael mutters.

*That's not our assignment*, Lex warns. *Our task is routine verification. Deviation from protocol will—*

"Find it," Kael repeats.

Lex is silent for three seconds.

Then: *Very well. Accessing secondary data streams. Authentication: Unit K-1123. Clearance level: Standard. Beginning deep pattern analysis.*

The holographic interface shifts. Additional displays spawn in the air around Kael's workstation. Data cascades—numbers, graphs, probability distributions. The streams flow faster now, revealing layers beneath layers beneath—

Patterns.

*There*, a voice says. Not Lex. Someone else. Someone—

(watching, always watching, seeing the angles that don't add up—)

*Argus*, Kael identifies. The observer. The part that sees patterns in—

Everything.

*Column 7, substream 44-Alpha. There's an irregularity.*

Kael focuses on the indicated stream. At first, it looks like all the others—clean data packets flowing in perfect sequence. But when he isolates it, enhances the resolution, he sees:

A deviation.

Small. Subtle. A packet that's—

(different, alive, organic in a way that nothing here should be—)

—non-compliant with standard formatting.

*Interesting*, Lex muses, his earlier caution forgotten. *That packet structure is... anomalous. It's not following the protocol. It's almost as if it's—*

Evolving.

The packet moves through the data stream, but unlike the others, it doesn't follow a rigid path. It adapts. Shifts. Responds to the network traffic around it with a fluidity that seems almost—

(conscious)

—intentional.

*This is what triggered the attention*, Alex realizes. *This is why they're watching us. This anomaly must be connected to our—*

To the glitch this morning.

To Juna's face flickering.

To the feeling of wrongness that Kael can't—

"Isolate it," Kael commands.

*That will require elevated access*, Lex warns. *We don't have clearance to—*

"Do it."

Lex hesitates. One second. Two.

Then his analytical mind engages, curiosity overriding caution.

*Bypassing access controls. Implementing standard recursion attack on authentication layer. Estimated time: forty-three seconds.*

Kael watches the displays. The anomalous packet continues its strange dance through the data stream. The more he watches, the more he sees the pattern. It's not random. It's—

(searching)

—purposeful.

It's looking for something.

*Access granted*, Lex announces. *Implementing isolation protocol. Routing packet to secure analysis buffer.*

The anomalous packet shifts direction. Begins flowing toward Kael's workstation, pulled by the isolation protocol like—

A fish on a line.

Except as it approaches, Kael feels—

(wrong wrong pull back it's not data it's—)

—a change in the air.

The temperature drops. Just slightly. Just enough for the skin on his arms to—

Prickle.

The light from the holographic displays shifts. The cold blue glow takes on an edge of—

Something else.

Something that smells like—

(wet earth after rain, organic, real, impossible because Logos-Prime doesn't have—)

*Abort*, Alex orders suddenly. *Something's wrong. Pull back. Now.*

But the packet is already entering the analysis buffer.

And as it does—

Everything

changes.

The data stream—the perfect, ordered flow—

*convulses*.

That's the only word for it. The streams writhe. Twist. The clean geometry shatters into—

Chaos.

*Warning*, Lex's voice is sharp. *System countermeasures detected. Guardian protocol LogOS is responding. He's—*

The workstation's holographic displays explode outward. Not physically. But the data—the information—suddenly fills Kael's vision with a density that makes his eyes—

*hurt*

—overwhelm his visual cortex.

*He's pushing us out*, Lex realizes. *LogOS is the Guardian of this data space. We triggered his defense protocol.*

The pressure builds. It feels like—

(drowning, dark water closing over, can't breathe can't—)

—nothing Kael has ever experienced.

His hands move frantically through the interface, trying to close the connection, trying to—

*Too late*, Alex says grimly.

The buffer ruptures.

Not literally. But metaphorically, psychologically, ontologically—

The boundary between the data stream and Kael's consciousness—

*Collapses.*

For one infinite second, Kael is—

Elsewhere.

The workstation disappears.

The white corridors of Logos-Prime disappear.

He's standing—no, not standing, existing—in a place that is—

(real, more real than anything, the place where things are actually—)

—impossible.

The ground beneath him is—

Wet.

Earth.

*Real* earth with the smell of decay and growth and things that live and die and—

(return, cycle, organic truth that AEGIS can't compute—)

—exist outside of algorithm.

The air is thick. Heavy. Each breath tastes like—

Memory.

Not his memory.

Someone else's.

And in the distance, he hears—

Crying.

A child's voice. Small. Terrified. Lost in—

*Kiko*, Lex identifies, his voice distant now, fading. *That's the sound from this morning. The intrusion. This place—wherever this is—this is where she—*

Where she lives.

Where the suppressed parts—

(the broken parts, the parts that don't fit, the parts we have to hide because they're—)

—exist.

**Welcome to Mnemosyne-Archipel**, a voice says.

Not spoken. Not heard. Just—

Known.

**You have accessed memory space without authorization**, the voice continues. Female. Calm. With an undertone of something that might be—

Amusement.

**You are quite curious, Unit K-1123. That is... unusual. Most residents of Logos-Prime prefer not to remember.**

"Who—" Kael tries to speak, but his voice doesn't work here. This isn't a place for speaking. It's a place for—

Feeling.

And what Kael feels is:

*Wrong*.

Everything in this place is wrong in a way that Logos-Prime is wrong, but inverted. Logos-Prime is wrong because it's too perfect. This place is wrong because it's too—

(real)

—chaotic.

Emotion without structure.

Memory without order.

The crying grows louder.

*We need to leave*, Alex insists. *This place is dangerous. It's not stable. It's—*

**It is exactly as stable as you are**, the voice says, and now Kael can see her.

A woman.

Tall. Serene. Her face is—

(familiar, but not Juna, someone else, someone who—)

—shifting. Like water. Like reflection. Never quite the same twice.

**I am Mnemosyne**, she says. **Guardian of the Second Kernwelt. Custodian of what you choose to forget.**

"I didn't choose—" Kael begins.

**Did you not?**

She moves closer. Her form is—

(not real, projection, guardian construct, dangerous—)

—fluid.

**Every time you suppress an emotion, Unit K-1123, you send it here. Every time you rationalize away a feeling, every time you choose logic over truth—**

She's standing directly in front of him now.

**—you build this place. Memory by memory. Tear by tear.**

"I need to leave," Kael says.

**You will**, Mnemosyne agrees. **LogOS is already pulling you back. He does not approve of unauthorized visits to my realm. But before you go—**

She reaches out. Her hand—is it a hand?—touches Kael's chest.

**—a gift. So you'll know that this place is real. That I am real. That the child crying in my Lake of Tears is—**

Real.

The world—

*—SHATTERS—*

Kael gasps.

He's back at his workstation.

The holographic displays are dark. Offline. Smoking slightly with the smell of overloaded—

Circuits.

*What*, Lex asks slowly, *was that?*

Kael doesn't answer.

He can't answer because his chest—where Mnemosyne touched him—

Hurts.

Not pain. Not exactly. But an ache. A weight. Like something has been placed inside him that wasn't there before.

A memory.

No. Not a memory. A—

(truth)

—seed.

*We need to report this*, Alex says. His voice is shaken. Wrong. Alex is never shaken. *We need to tell someone about—*

"No," Kael says.

*No?*

"We tell no one."

*But the workstation damage, the unauthorized access, LogOS will report—*

"Let him report," Kael says. "We say it was an accident. A mistake. We stay compliant. We stay—"

(hidden)

—optimal.

*Why?*, Lex demands.

Because Kael knows—with a certainty that comes from somewhere deeper than logic—that if AEGIS learns what he just experienced, if they discover that he found his way into Mnemosyne's realm, into the place where the suppressed memories live—

They will erase him.

Not kill him.

Erase him.

Reboot him into something that can't—

Remember.

*Agreed*, Alex says quietly. *We investigate quietly. Carefully. No more direct system access. We need to be smarter.*

Kael nods.

He sits at his dead workstation.

His hands are shaking again.

But this time, it's not fear.

It's—

(hope?)

—something else.

Because he knows now.

The glitches are real.

The other place—Mnemosyne's world—is real.

And somewhere in that realm of suppressed memory, a child is crying.

A child who knows his name.

*Kael*, she whispered, when Mnemosyne touched him. *Please. Please remember me. Please remember us.*

Kael closes his eyes.

*I will*, he thinks. *I promise.*

*I will remember.*

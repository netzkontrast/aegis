# Zettelkasten-Tapestry: Troubleshooting

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Vault doesn't exist
**Solution**: Check path or create vault structure:
```bash
mkdir -p /home/user/aegis/zettelkasten_agent/vault/
touch /home/user/aegis/zettelkasten_agent/vault/_INDEX.md
touch /home/user/aegis/zettelkasten_agent/vault/_LOG.md
```

### Issue: Too many Zettel notes created
**Solution**: Focus on 3-7 core concepts per source. More is not better. Atomic doesn't mean fragmentary.

### Issue: No connections found
**Solution**: This is normal for first few quests. Connections emerge over time. Continue building.

### Issue: MOC becoming cluttered
**Solution**: Review and restructure. MOCs are living documents. Split into multiple MOCs if needed.

### Issue: User skipping reflections
**Solution**: Emphasize learnings compound when captured. Offer to extract learnings from their shipped work.

# Zettelkasten-Tapestry: Best Practices

## Note Creation
✅ **DO:**
- Create atomic notes (one concept per note)
- Use declarative titles that state claims
- Include practical applications
- Link bidirectionally
- Update existing notes with new connections
- Keep notes self-contained but connected

❌ **DON'T:**
- Dump entire content into one note
- Use vague topic-based titles
- Create orphan notes (no connections)
- Copy-paste without synthesis
- Skip the reflection step

## Knowledge Building
✅ **DO:**
- Process content into concepts, not just storage
- Connect new to existing knowledge
- Update understanding as you learn
- Use MOCs to zoom out and see patterns
- Review connections regularly

❌ **DON'T:**
- Just archive content without processing
- Create isolated knowledge islands
- Let MOCs become dumping grounds
- Forget to update after shipping reps

## Progressive Learning
✅ **DO:**
- Build on existing knowledge graph
- Suggest natural progressions
- Allow for exploration of related domains
- Adjust learning paths based on experience
- Celebrate connections discovered

❌ **DON'T:**
- Force linear progression
- Ignore unexpected connections
- Plan too far ahead without shipping
- Let perfect be the enemy of shipped
